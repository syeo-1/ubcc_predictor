To the guy who was on the 14 going to UBC from downtown at about 2pm on November 22nd:
Thank you so much for asking if I was okay and diverting the attention of the man sitting beside me. I was really lost at what to do... I never got to thank you!...

With the impending bus strike happening soon, I'm surprised only UBC people are the only ones smart enough to decide camping on campus while SFU and BCIT people decide to walk that hour long trip to school

need to get this off my chest,

A couple weeks ago I was walking home around 3am. I walked past the corner of totem and saw my very first live porn show. The blinds were up and I had a full view of two people engaging in intercourse and I couldn't look away. I felt guilty for watching, but I continued to stare. I learnt more in the 15 minutes I stood in front of that room than anything I have seen on the internet. Thank you UBC for providing me with sex ed. As to the couple, W O W that was passionate.

I'm sorry but fuck camping out at the nest because of the bus strike. Let's camp outside Santa Ono's office at Koerner's library in protest for the lack of support UBC's offering especially due to the lack of parking space due to graduation at the same time as the bus strike and exhorbitant parking prices. We pay to be here, so don't penalize us for not being able to get here and then do absolutely nothing to provide support. You supported the climate strike, we actually need your active support now. Step up.

A few weeks ago our prof showed us a video on youtube and wanted to show it again so she reloaded the entire page. There was a collective gasp as everyone watched in horror for the way she chose to restart the video. The problem is, ever since that class I've gotten into the habit of replaying youtube videos that way and I'm terrified someone will see over my shoulder and wonder why I'm choosing that way to replay the video.
So long story short I started reloading the page to replay youtube videos and now I cant stop!

I'm a second year student in Sauder and I've finally come to realise how accurate this whole Sauder snake thing is. How can we not be snakes when even our own CUS is basically forcing students to pay hundreds of dollars for them to spend however they like?
https://cus.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Q12019Report.pdf
Just look at this budget... 18k on retreats for CUS execs, 48k for POITS, 222k Miscellaneous??????? Can someone please tell me where 222k just disappeared to? is the CUS straight up embezzling our money? Why are we even giving our money to a bunch of students to manage anyway?

To all the clubs who got screwed over today (Nov 20) because AMS bookings double booked your space please reach out to your faculty’s AMS reps. Schedule an appointment with them and explain what happened and how this could be avoided in the future.

I can’t believe that AMS booking reps prioritize paid bookings over student club bookings. This is completely unacceptable. I heard that 3 clubs had to share 1 space because the film production bought out multiple event spac...

The thing I like about Buchanan Tower is that I can tell who is in my department and who is not when I step in the elevator and observe who pressed which numbers. And since I am in the History department, I get to look at everyone who pressed the numbers 10 or below as weaklings, since I am literally on top of them.

I don't know how my roommate got into UBC. Instead of turning down the thermos when it gets too warm, she opens the door so it cools down, while the heat is still on! which leads to increase in temperature in other parts of the house because the temp sensor is by the door and senses the outside temperature. leading to temperature as high as 35C. UBC needs to reevaluate their high school science admission requirements.

There was a dead rat on the sidewalk and I just kind of sat there for a while waiting for someone to step on it. Y'all did not disappoint, definitely the most fun i've had in ages watching people step on the rat and then absolutely freak. Big shout out to the lady who stepped on the rat, locked eyes with me, and then, in a horrified voice, whispered "I killed a rat!" before BOOKING it as fast as she could, like she'd just committed murder. Wish I could have let her know she wasn't actually guilty of rat-ocide but that woman was Gone.

It was my first week at UBC, and I brought leftover pizza to eat for lunch. However, not knowing the campus at all, I searched high and low for a microwave to indulge my craving for reheated pepperoni. At long last, the microwave in the lower bowl of the NEST provided the heat necessary to satisfy my cravings. Little did I know that my mozzarella had seemingly become liquid, overflowing it’s doughy banks and flooding the glass plate. Upon opening the door, I immediately realized the horror of my crimes, and fled the scene, praying for minimal witnesses. To this day, that microwave haunts my dreams, and I offer my sincerest apologies to the sorry sucker who was forced to clean my disastrous mozzarella catastrophe...

You know those people camping out at IKB for days on end? They're not even physically THERE they just leave their laptops and so you gotta pass by without taking the seat and just hate their guts cause the seat is EMPTY??? Anyways, I've started just collecting those laptops. I mean, if you wanted it you wouldn't just leave it there right?? I've gotten so many laptops that I'm literally just paying my tuition with them at this point. But the REAL POINT of this confession isn't that I feel bad (I don't). It's that I WANT YOU to join me!! If we instill enough (justified) fear and paranoia in the UBC population, then we might finally take our seats at IKB back. DO IT. Free laptops + make IKB a better place. DO IT.

In my second week at UBC, a floor mate and I were talking about different science majors in a residence floor lounge as first-years. I said "I'm interested in CAPS," and my RA chuckled and said "you're not getting into CAPS."

You're right. I did not get into CAPS because I never applied. I got into another major that I was more interested in. But, my grades were high enough to get into CAPS (90%+, first and second year, sorry for the weird flex) but what a rude fucking thing to say. You do not know me, so don't say condescending things like that to your residents. We all have dreams and ambitions in first-year, and you crushed that during my second week of school.

I fucking hate my roommate so I use their toothbrush to clean the toilet. The rim, stains, crusty dried shit, just everything. Then I realized that I'm probably improving my roommate's immune system, so my roomie better be thankful. I'm honestly such an angel, looking out for their health and everything even when I hate them. I wish everybody was thoughtful like me. Learn to respect your roommates. Clean with their toothbrush.

Ever since i was young, I always loved eating my boogers. When I mean love, I mean that I scrape my nostrils at least twice a day and swirl the delicious things in my mouth for a good couple of minutes. It's something about the salty and chewy sensation that I can't get over. Surely I can't be the only one doing this, I highly recommend others to try.

Where to even start. I'm feeling such a mix of disappointment and frustration that this is probably just going to end up as an incoherent rant.

So I'm aware there's rampant cheating and academic dishonesty going on, but during my time at UBC I've never really encountered it. But now that I've actually been more exposed to it, I'm extremely disappointed. I guess both at how money really runs the world and academic institutions for letting it happen....

It rattles me sometimes see some of the coldest people I’ve encountered post about mental health awareness. Cute trendy posts with lots of emojis and suggestions for self-care, but no sense of real-world application when it comes to treating others with kindness. Recently asked my group project partner to take on his fair share of the work (right now the split is 30/70 him/me), explaining I was in a tough spot with workload right now and struggling to hold myself toget...

There's this girl that I like in my class. I asked her if she wanted to be in my LING group for a group project at UBC, and she accepted. I doubt she'll ever like me, but the closest we have been was being in the same cell and masturbating.

Sometimes it's by accident, but most of the times I will intentionally go to the place that she's in and start fapping. She'll be typing in data for the project, and I'll just be there for her, if she needs anything. It feels really...

I was admitted in to a very competitive program under Sauder. After two weeks in Sauder, I found myself really unhappy because I didn't like the vibes there. It started to affect my mental health. I didn't like it when most of the Sauder kids seemed to care about nothing but grades, internship experiences, VP positions... I n...

I started a NSFW account online recently. I post half naked photos of myself without showing my face or revealing too much personal info. It’s been really exciting and I get a ton of positive comments.
In a weird way, the external validation has transformed into intrinsic self love and confidence. I was always super shy around boys because I thought I was ugly and they could never be attracted to me. But I was flooded with messages from guys calling me cute and realized “wow I’m actually super cute!!! I had no idea!!” It’s a real ego boost :)

ubc mental health services are the biggest joke. I’ve been seeing them for 2 months about my depression and anxiety, and at this point i don’t even see the point in going anymore. They pass me around like a joke, and send me to different people to sit in a room only to be given the same piece of paper I’ve received multiple times. I’ve wasted my time going to these stupid sessions thinking they could help me, only to be given a piece of paper that i can just print off online.

I thought my life was over when I got withdrawn and it was the most difficult time of my life, I shut out anything from my life that reminded me of UBC.

Who in the world is trying to hack into my lecture slides that UBC needs a data security system more powerful than what I need to access my bank account. So now in my great attempt to focus I have ended up with nothing more to do than scroll through confessions i guess :/

When people say student societies are snakes, they usually think about the AMS, SUS, or AUS, but being a graduating Computer Engineering student, I can tell the ECE student society is the worst of them all. Not only our department, but also our student society is an absolute joke. Each year, we pay more than $100 to student society fees, and we barely see that money put to use.

While other Engineering departments have undergraduate societies that have caring and whole...

Bhaskar Yechuri Thanky can correct me on this, but ECESS gets the smallest amount of funding per student (from the EUS) of any engineering society (~$7/student compared to other societies, which get twice as much per student).
So, no wonder they're unable to fund anything apart from small events :/

I was changing in my room the other day and I didn't realize that my blinds weren't fully rotated closed until I heard people shouting outside telling me to take off my clothes. First off, my fault for not shuttering the blinds, but also, tf. I'm not stare into someone's bedroom from outside for like a full 3-4 minutes, what type of creep gets off on that. Seriously. UBC get your shit together.

- Sincerely, someone who wants to change in the privacy of their own room, but will now keep their blinds permanently closed.

I brought my friends home one night. We were planning to play some music in the room. I turned on the speaker first. At the moment I was about to turn on the Bluetooth on my phone, we heard some weird sound. People were having sex and their conversations were so clear.
Me and my friends were shocked. Everyone was staring at me.
Then I realized my roomie was watching porn in his room and accidentally connecting his phone to my speaker🤦‍♀️

I watched porn with a girl for the first time today. I always thought it would have been in a sexual scenario but we just lay in bed and went through random tags. We're not into each other but I can definitely say that it was a unique, bonding experience.

I really don't get what's up with Arts Co-op's "no more than two consecutive work terms in a row policy" when the co-op conferences show lots of examples of co-op students with more than two work terms in a row. Yeah, like we learn this and that, and then see examples of violating this rule.

I am really sick of seeing posts about how awful UBC counselling is. YES its awful, we ALL KNOW THIS. If you are in need of someone to talk to please use Empower Me. It is seriously the most underrated service that UBC has to offer and they can usually get you to a counsellor within a WEEK for FREE. The service allows you to access 4-6 free sessions with a counsellor NEAR TO WHERE YOU LIVE, and if the counsellor thinks you need more sessions they can apply for more free sessions with the service. So go ahead and make an appointment with UBC counselling, and while you have to WAIT call Empower Me to see someone sooner in the meantime! UBC pays for this service because it knows it does not have the resources to support all of us, so make use of them!

I know Chinese international students are a gold mine for UBC, but is that really worth UBC's soul? Huawei's research funding is only 9.5 million. Combined with internationals, that's 19.5 million. That's less than one percent of UBC's annual budget and it was enough to get them fretting about. I'm a Chinese student in the Asian Studies (language stream) major. My profs and I shouldn't have to be censored in Canada because what we discuss in our school offends the Chinese Communist Party on the other side of the earth.

I grew up in a really strict household my whole life. Being on my own now in my first year has given me some great opportunities, and I feel free to try new things and do what I never had the chance to. Moving into residence, one of the things I was most excited for was being able to have candles in my room. I love how simple it is and it really calms me down when I’m studying or hanging out with my new friends. But having them made me curious and I need to ask the question:

Why the fuck don’t candles taste like their smell?

I can't F*king stay awake at night. It's the cold whether outside which makes me wanna curl up in my fluffy blankey and just get 7 hours of sleep, which is way too much for a UBC student. This may sound like I am overreacting, but with 4-5 courses a day, my energy drains and I am still left with excessive assignments and homework.

I broke a door glass pane on UBC campus today. I was stressed about midterms and walking down a hallway, and I just kicked a door and the glass shattered. I immediately panicked and left. Only one person witnessed it. They looked scared. I phoned my parents and decided to turn myself in for the unforgivable crime that I’ve committed. I phoned the department within 30 minutes, gave them my contact information, apologized over and over again and promised to pay any fines. What should I do? Will they expel me? I’m scared and I know I shouldn’t have done it because I’m an adult and I need other ways to vent my constant stress and anxiety over making decisions. Please give advice, I’m scared this will ruin everything my parents have done for me

Hello, your friendly Philosophy Major here!

You think that your degree is best? Think again! "Ohhh I'm a science student. We have everything figured out. We only deal in concrete realities that we can empirically prove". Cavemen. Your studies would make no sense without a philosophy of science. Do you ever stop and evaluate how the scientific method could be flawed? It can't show causation at all, only conjunction. Y'all can't even precisely measure the position and m...

Gentle reminder to take care of yourself before midterms and finals. I know you’re stressed and cramming, but for god’s sake, eat before you come to write the paper, and get your flu shots. If I hear your stomach growling or you coughing, sneezing and sniffling the whole time, I might just call you out publicly.

Also special mention to my people who stress themselves into an upset stomach. FYI: we can tell hunger sounds from imminent explosive diarrhea. I feel for you...

People act as if LGBT people who are straight-passing should have some sort of humility because they have the privilege of passing as straight. I notice it especially in Vancouver for some reason. Honestly wtf? I'm not any less gay just because I'm currently in a heterosexual relationship. Have any of these people ever considered that LGBT people who are straight-passing take advantage of their privilege in order to protect themselves from homophobic family or peers? Like I'm sorry that I'm apparently "not gay enough" because I currently love someone of the opposite gender and don't want to be disowned lol

Christine Lee if you’re feeling suicidal or have extreme anxiety symptoms remember you can call ambulance, walk into ER. In big hospitals there’s usually at least one psychiatrist around in case of mental health emergencies.

The Woodward library seriously needs to update the old men's toilets. I had to take a crap there today, and the toilets are so shallow that my penis literally hangs 5 mm from touching the puddle of water (not to mention the other inconveniences). I flushed twice (because I'm a gentlemen) and somehow the handle got jammed causing the toilet to flush infinitely while I was still sitting causing my penis to get all wet (not the same feeling as getting head). UBC needs to account for men with above average penises because this was the last straw for me!

I was at a wedding this weekend and I hit it off with this guy. We ended up making out. After the fact, I found out our parents are cousins. Is it wrong that I want to see him again?

I had to buy the coffee from Cafe Arrigano (spelling idk?) down 43rd, near the Save On Foods because I had to take an explosive shit. Bought something because I was using the washroom. I don't like to drink coffee. When I gave the coffee to you, I actually really had to take a 2nd explosive shit. I'm pretty sure this was 9:30am @ the Life Building on Oct 24th, because I was late for that one Psychology 217 lab.

As of the few days of the strike against Translink, I love seeing our bus-driving homies in turtleneck sweaters or hoodies. It makes me feel right at home to be driven to UBC by a lad in a baseball cap.

I'm incredibly glad that it's just a maintenance and overtime ban, and not a full-scale strike. I'm grateful of the transit system we have in moments like these. (I just got my bike stolen right before the strike, thanks Vancouver)...

So I was chilling with my partner in my house and she said "lets watch porn". So we started watching porn, and there was some weird shit. She selected a pretty bad video. And there we were, I just wanted to watch The Office but she insisted on us watching porn. Then she said it was enough but I could tell she was horny so while watching The Office I tried masturbating her. She literally just started laughing. Then I went into fb and started writing this confession and she is laughing next to me while reading all of this. So you know, good stuff...

UBC Counselling has got to be the biggest publicity stunt this university has ever pulled off. How can you not take appointments online? Do they ever consider the students who need it most are not going to land up at 8 am fresh as a daisy and are desperately trying to pull their lives together but whenever I go to the office its booked out for the next 500000000 years. When I did go the office they handed me a sheet with a bunch of numbers on it which I could've pulled off from the net. All I want is an appointment. It really shouldn't be this hard.

Morgan LK Keep trying! I know it’s tough. Maybe they changed stuff... but when you go in they give you a form to fill out for assessment, and then you get a person to assess you (usually that day) after that it may take a while to see someone, but they do base it off of previewed severity from that initial visit with a counsellor. Give it a go!

Okay so recently I've kind of realized how dumb I am. Maybe not 'dumb' exactly, but I always thought I was pretty smart until recently when I've been comparing my grades with my friends and they're all getting grades above mine. I got discouraged at first, and was sad because I realized how dumb I was, but now I actually love it. It's made me realize how better I can be and how much more efficient I can study and get shit done. It's pushing me to not be as careless and cocky with my grades and actually try. I love being surrounded by smart people and I'm proud to have smart friends who inspire me to be better. For anyone else who feels dumb, I hope this helps you. But even amidst comparing grades and whatever else, remember to focus on yourself and doing the best that YOU can. Happy midterm/almost finals season :)

One of the things we have to learn in university, if you haven't learned it before, is to accept rejection gracefully. To be rejected, without rejecting yourself. But I believe you'll roll over again and get back up :)

I would like to thank any and all individuals that bring their doggos to campus. As a suffering undergraduate, sometimes the only thing that keeps me going is witnessing a smol floof on fur prancing around the fountain and living his or her best life. I've literally had moments when I was on the verge of a mental breakdown while walking to a final I knew I was going to fail but broke out into the biggest smile when I saw a big ol woofer grace me with his presence as he passed by. Life is stressful but dogs are good.

I am so disappointed with UBC housing. My unit not only has carpet beetles, but now also silverfish! When I contacted ubc housing services about it they just sent people to clean? Like BICH thats not going to fucking help we need a solution and they just dont seem to give a fuck. How can there be so many things wrong with housing on campus? UBC needs to get their fucking shit together, why are we paying so much money for tuition/housing if its going to be as shitty as this?

The way sororities raise money at their philanthropies really irks me. They have systems where the person with the most amount of money in their jar after a certain amount is deemed the "winner", which gives their fraternity/sorority some kind of glory.

David Byres Fun fact: the fire system can track what set it off and if it is located to someone specific they will be fined for a false alarm.
There is often just no information to pass on to you if an alarm is pulled so dont be mad. The university also shouldn't have to apologize for a student pulling the alarm....

Earlier today, while visiting my second favourite bubble tea shop, I ran out of toilet paper at the worst possible moment. Thankfully I had my trusty tree-free AMS planner. I could've ripped out my old planner pages, but no, I went straight for the page with AMS Prez Chris Hakim's biography. Thanks again for trying to close down the SASC, and for the emergency toilet paper.

While we're talking about shitty groups of people at UBC, is anyone going to mention varsity athletes? When are these men going to start being called out for the way they aggressively objectify women? Now some teams are worse than others, but being in tons of arts classes where groups of those stupid blue jackets will chill at the back of the class & dedicate all the intellectual energy expenditure they have for the week to sharing DETAILS of girls they've slept with i...

She didn't know me, just offered to give me her free coffee ( starbucks happy hour) and when I asked why she said that I looked like I was having a bad day and that she was going ...

He made direct eye contact with me and when he saw that we were cool he climbed the little wall next to the bench and just kinda chilled there for a bit.

I like listening to rap music before a presentation or an interview. It gets me hyped up and ready to go. We usually have interviews in Sauder and I was listening to some while waiting to be called in for mine. When I got called, I turned it off and followed my interviewer into a room. Around 5 mins in, I hear these noises. I innocently thought it was just noise from the students outside. But, for some reason, once I started to concentrate on the sounds, I realized it ...

Why did people ask my number when I was waiting for my friend at the fountain. My look brings me so many troubles. I even feel disconnected from my body when I see people staring at me in the gym.

If you aren’t familiar with the architecture of broadway city hall, there is no overhead covering for people waiting for the 99.

Ugh. Sometimes I fear these confessions really aren’t anonymous and the admins really know who is specifically tied to each confession. Then they have a black market where they sell the identities of certain confessions to others, and there’s this secret room with all these files and it’s like a mugshot then beside it says like: gets aroused from cumming on fruit, or pretends gf is hentai angel

Has anyone else ever tried studying in the Nest on Monday nights? I love studying in that building at night cause most people usually leave and it's nice and quiet. Except every single freaking Monday. I don't know what this club is doing but it's constant screaming over and over for no reason whatsoever. Is this really necessary? My brain hurts listening to it. I would go to the library but it's always so busy, so now i've ended up going to different residence commons blocks to try and get work done.

Trigger Warning: Mental health

A week ago in a middle of severe anxiety attack, I called UBC counselling to schedule an appointment. No one was picking up so I left a message stating my name and my need for an appointment. I literally called in on a workday and a week later, I still haven’t gotten any answer from them at all. What? Y’all really wanting to see how long a student can last before she kill herself?

Janette Yu Making the first step can be hard, but remember your classes are big and if you mess up with someone, you can always find new people! That's the good thing with university. It may be disheartening at first, but if you keep trying you're bound to meet people who you work with :). You had friends in the past, I'm sure you can make friends now, but it'll take more effort as you wont see them often.

This is likely going to anger some people but oh well. So a lot of the UBC memes are about making fun of arts students and, as an art student, I find them HILARIOUS. They make for a good laugh and people need to not take them so seriously. HOWEVER, I do have an issue when that mindset is transferred into hurtful words that are meant to put someone down. And before y’all complain and say shit like “this is why nobody likes arts students...

You know what is heavily underrated, student resources and support at UBC. Frankly, the institutions on campus are beyond abundant in terms of aiding students to succeed. From office hours directly with the professor where you can directly ask questions, to centres with upper year tutors both of which are completely free. And all class information is available online directly at the Canvas so you can never lose anything, or miss anything even if you miss class. And if ...

I didn’t realize that class rank or being above the average mattered, so I was always willing to send out my notes or help other people instead of studying myself or even to give out answers. But now that I know, I’m wondering if I should start distancing myself from my classmates? I don’t want to see them as competition, but I’m worried that I played myself... I feel selfish, but at the same time I need to do anything and everything necessary to do well. My family is putting everything into my education and counting on me to do well in the future.

Does anyone else just wake up some mornings really hating their own appearance? Like there may be no difference from how you look usually but you just really really hate your own face and body that certain day? I'm still trying to figure out where my sudden self hatred comes from but it's been years and I still haven't got a clue. I've gotten my fair share of compliments and people have said that I look attractive on numerous occasion...

TW: suicide

Last year was a really hard year for me, I struggled a lot with my mental health and I really hit rock bottom. I couldn’t focus in class, I could barely understand anything in any of my classes, and I couldn’t find the motivation to study. By the end of the year, I had failed most of my term 2 classes and was requested to withdraw from the faculty I was in. I saw it coming, but it still was a shock to me. I couldn’t tell anyone because I was so embarrassed....

Very disappointed that the UBC Global Lounge is employing a Holocaust denying Anti-Semite, who upon learning I was from Israel launched a hateful rhetoric against me despite stating several times I had no desire to discuss politics, I just came there to use the study space.

TL:DR Don't be worried that you are still a virgin and single, live your life and love yourself, go at life at your own pace.

Going into uni (and pretty much all of high school), I've always been insecure that I am still a virgin and I will be single for life. So going into uni, I asked every second girl out and just wanna get laid. Rejection and after rejection, I felt worse and worse as I started losing hope in myself. I thought not a girl in the world will ever like...

I know it sounds cheesy but I am so excited to get out there and vote on Monday, October 21, 2019( I say as I’m writing this at 1 am oct.21) Just something about exercising your right to vote is something that I will not take for granted because no matter how much it may seem that your vote doesn’t matter, it really does. So all you People’s out there who are over 18 and a Canadian citizen PLEASE VOTE! This election is once every 4 years so if you could go to a voting poll with valid pieces of ID and your voting card that you can also print from online and do your dang civil duty and vote.

My friend and I were studying in Ponderosa (Education room 1001) and we ordered a fuck ton of Domino's for a late 11:30 dinner. So we're eating this pizza and we left the door open when bringing it in, and we see this old lady walk by (grey hair, coat, glasses, very soft voice, in case anyone knows who she is). She points at us from the hallway and says "you guys need dessert :^)" and keeps walking. About 5mins later she walks into the room with 2 of each: bananas, mandarins and apples. She drops them off with a smile and we say bye. I dunno who she is but if any of you know based on my shoddy-ass description please let her know she's a true G and she made our night!

A group of us were so sad and we went to check up on him and to apologize to him for that sick behavior from someone who is so jealous from the wonderful success that Walid made over a very short period of time.

We were shocked, Walid was, as usual, smiling and gave us a very valuable lesson, he said ''you never pay attention to insecure voice...

I’m in the CHEM 235 lab this term and they have this rule that your ankles have to be fully covered. Basically not even a millimetre of your skin can be showing, and there’s someone at the door who compulsively checks everyone coming in for even the slightest violation of this rule. Now this is turning out to be a problem for me since I’m a guy who’s super horny and really enjoys seeing the sight of female ankle here and there around campus. I can’t stand to spend three hours in a room where these beautiful womanly ankles are covered by long and thick socks. Like what am I even supposed to stare and lust at in the lab? I get the whole safety thing, but I wish the Chem department would loosen up their rules a bit to help out a man in need of some sexual satisfaction. Even just one inch would be enough.

I'll be honest if Bio didn't take up half my time in Science One then I'd be mentally well and have enough time to do everything and study. But nope here I am losing marks on saying "exhaled" instead of "into the air" for where glycogen goes and apparently misidentifying a tree that has a name plate on it from the Botanical garden :)

Myself and several other people I know have stolen an obscene number of things from different places on campus. Security in most of UBC’s stores is really lacking and their products are overpriced as hell. I’m just paranoid that they’ve known this whole time and eventually are going to come after us once it’s amounted to like, thousands of dollars worth of product.

Everyone’s on here talking about how much they love Walid but no one is mentioning the fact that he literally ran a tutoring scam where he took advantage of naive undergrads. He tricked them into sneaking into lectures and taking notes for him so he could sell them in his tutoring business, promised to pay them for their time and never did! When the department of chemistry found out they made him shut it down but honestly he should have been fired and not allowed to teach ever again. Y’all are obsessed with Walid but you guys are blinded by love - the dude is a snake.

UBC is a very messy and dirty place confirmed.

I went to get blood work done to get checked for STDs at the UBC hospital (like HIV) before I began being sexually actively with my boyfriend. The guy was asking me if getting tested for HIV was a requirement for UBC students because literally everyone was getting tested? I was like yeah it was a requirement so the guy wouldn’t think I’m slutty bdamn how much sex can university students have? I barely have time to even breathe...

I tell my friends I can't study with them because they're too distracting, but the truth is I can only focus when I'm dressed up like a squat thot that exclusively shops at lululemon. This wouldn't be a problem if I weren't a cis white male.

Well I have a doozy of a story about how rude and down right crazy people can be here. I have submitted in this confession my statement of events which I submitted to campus security after a confrontation that occurred when I came to use a study room in Woodward. I walked into a study room with my headphones in and I had a student rudely tell me to leave, even though she hadn't booked the room and it was just her in the room.

UBC is a great institution that has provided me with many skills and experiences I will cherish forever. But one thing that really annoys me is the undergrad culture. University is supposed to be the best time of our lives where you find lifelong friends and enjoy being young. But everyone here is too concerned with grades, internships and beating their competition. REMINDER: DO NOT WASTE THIS TIME by worrying about things that won't matter once you graduate. Relax and make these years memorable! Everything will work out and you will get through it!

Luke Yin Don't fail your classes but for the most part, you'll be fine as long as you graduate. It's sad that this is still a problem in 2019. Campus culture was improving significantly during my last couple of years at UBC, and I haven't heard any complaints until now. Go meet some people at clubs and parties--especially Calendar parties--and see if things improve for you.

To all the people who give more than they get in a friendship: you deserve better. The times you sacrificed study time to check in with a friend youre worried about, and the time you spend just trying to arrange plans to meet up. This is for you. You are worthy of a friendship where the other party is just as dedicated as you are. A friendship where they also understand that this isnt high school anymore and friendships take some effort.

im RELIEVED they installed a crossing system on wesbrook mall near ubc hospital rather than keep the “press the button to cross” system. i know pedestrians have a right of way but i was always so anxious crossing there.

i see a bus and im like man i dont wanna hold up so many people, so i slow down to let the bus go but the driver slows down to let me go so i awkwardly press the button and do that slow awkward jog, and oh look there’s a car slowing down on the other side but im not even halfway cross the street yet, im so sorry you have to wait, so i jog a little faster and do an awkward wave at the driver like im sorry for taking up your time im so sorry - ALL OF THAT IS NO MORE. i am free to cross that road in peace.

I’m a science student. I’m taking an upper level course. The assignments are pretty tough and time consuming. Once, my friend took me to an off campus private tutorial for that course. I went with my friend since it was free at the first time. They gave us ‘lecture slides’ which was the solution of our future assignment. I was shocked and I knew that was cheating. I didn’t report it since I didn’t want to bring troubles to my friends. I decided to not study with those ...

You ever do something where you’re like wow yeah someone would definitely submit a confession about this. Like “saw a girl sitting in the back of my lecture. Just crying and eating spaghetti.” And you could tag your friends in it and be like “wow mood” but like. I am the spaghetti crying girl. No one knows. Except the one who submitted the confession.

I have this friend who always checks in on me by getting me to rate my MRESP (Mental, Romantic, Emotional, Social/Spiritual/Sexual, & Physical Wellness)- and like I love them but sometimes it feels like I'm an investment and they're just checking in to see how I'm doing so they know where their investment is at. Maybe they're doing the right thing because friendships are investments- but like, am I justified to feel quantified? I'm sorry and I love you <3 <3 <3 but this is how I've been feeling.

It's been years since my dad died, and honestly I thought I should have gotten over it by now. But lately, I've just been dwelling over it non-stop. I've been having dreams about him; one time it was when I met him for the first time (since I do not remember him, I was very young when he died), and when I woke up I just cried. Recently, I had another one where I was asking why he died, and if he even thought of me when he committed suic...

I'm no longer attracted to women. They're too loud, and the ones at UBC sleep around so much that it's unappealing. I listen to them speak and want to end my own life, so vapid is the conversation. I have taken my sexual energy and redirected it to superior 2D women. Anime girls are superior to real women in every way, it's really not even close. I have 200+ matches on Tinder but haven't messaged any, there would be no point, I do not want them, I only want to smash some anime pussy.

But last year, I ended up failing half my classes and was kicked out of UBC.

I realized how close we are to cuffing season, as I was booking rooms in Henry Angus. In that moment, I found booking names that told a better love-story than my own love life. Time to extrapolate, as if I was a wanna-be CRWR major. (All of the following characters are fictional representations)

SO i'm in a psychology class about babies and I'm studying at Starbucks for my midterm. I had a few windows open just trying to get organized and figure out how to start, you know that feeling when you haven't done any readings and are like ha ha ha where do I start

ANYWAYS, i'm flipping through my textbook and kind of feel like everyone around me is staring and i'm like hmmm.....
SO I look up at my laptop and notice that on my screen is a video of child birth....

I’m sorry that I’m Chinese. I didn’t get to pick. I’m sorry that my presence in this city and campus feels like an invasion. I didn’t choose to come here. I’m sorry that when you look at me, all you can see are my dark hair, dark eyes, and my small eyes. It’s just what I was born with. I’m sorry that your family and friends have had bad experiences with Asians. Except I’ve been bullied by countless people of your race as well. I’m sorry that my food smells bad to you. ...

Clare Venn Hey OP, if your roommate is making you really uncomfortable you can speak with your Residence Life Manager (RLM). Depending on the scenario they can help mediate a conversation with your roommate or even look into switching you to a different unit. You deserve to live somewhere where you feel your roommates respect your boundaries and ask for consent first.

Growing up without a sister I have always wondered in the LIFE Building what that metal tin box was and I thought it was a trash can until today to dispose my runny nose toilet paper I opened it and saw two bloody tampon that looked really disgusting in there and a diaper pad that i realized that these bins were for girls only and not a trash can. I guess I am still learning a lot in my first month of university

PSA for anyone who wants to do things: Don't.

As someone who is always the mover and shaker, let me tell you firsthand, people are ASSHOLES. You cannot rely on anyone except yourself. Have you known them since you were born? Can't rely on them. Are they related to you? DEFINITELY can't rely on them. The point is, if you want something in this life you better be prepared to work your ass off by YOURSELF. Because hell truly is other people....

I've had so many friends tell me about being touched/groped/molested at events and it's sickening to hear. The fact that so many grown-ass men (and yes, they are grown-ass whether they like it or not, everyone here is an adult now) don't know how to act like gentlemen, the fact that so many grown-ass men lack class, dignity, and accountability, the fact that so ma...

Its a beautiful study space. Just because the Commons is built and open now and there's study space there DOESNT mean that we undergrads dont want/need the arts atrium anymore. IM PISSED.

I find it alarming that the AMS turns a blind eye to the UBC Chinese Students and Scholars Association (an AMS club) and how close they've gotten with the local Chinese consulate in Vancouver over the recent years.

At clubs day, they openly admit to hosting events with the close support of the Chinese consulate in Vancouver and embassy in Ottawa. I'm not saying that this is wrong, because many cultural clubs do the same....

Okay, so let's take a second to talk about the construction going on at Wesbrook Mall/University Ave. I get that UBC has a construction fetish, in which they need to renovate something every 3 months in order to get off. HOWEVER, please get the fuck out of my crosswalk. It makes going to class even less appealing than usual and frankly one of these days I'm going to say "screw it" and walk blindly into traffic. Thank UBC for, once again, being incredibly irritating.

Many upper-years, myself included, roast the first years for their dumbass lanyards, but this year I started a co-op job in a research facility, and guess what? I’ve gotta wear a lanyard with my access card while I’m there. So, moral of the story, I guess I am now a fan-yard of the lanyard.

I'm deleting files on my hard drive to clear more space for papers this semester (and memes. gotta save those rare pepes), and I stumbled across some really shitty fanfiction I wrote back in first year about one of my PoliSci TAs going hot and heavy with then not-yet-Prime-Minister Justin Trudeau.

I'm shocked at how well it stands up today, given how much Justin Trudeau has stopped seeming like a weakly humourous joke and started feeling like a bad prank we played on ...

Tldr; Footballer's hair is blocking my view of the whole screen in class and I was too scared to say anything.

I walked in to class, the back of the class mind you as I'm a first year and I don't want to look too keen. The chairs are attached to the desk which seats about five people and I unpacked to get ready to learn, and pulled my water bottle out and set it on my desk. ...

It's only the third week of the semester and I've already cracked. I finally gave in to my deepest desires. I bought a Chegg account.

I really don't have the spare $20 laying around to buy the membership but I also don't have the brain cells to finish these assignments either. 10/10 would recommend, I've already finished three assignments and it's not even midnight.

I assist a research and it shooks me to realize that some publications depend on the undergrads' clumsy collections of data. If the entire findings rides on the authenticity of undergrads's knowledge then that can't be a substantial research. Or am I completely dumb and is that how academia work???

PSA to people with cars: I had my car broken into and had around $20 in coins stolen from my middle console. My shitty old beater car was parked in the Marine drive lot and didn't have anything valuable visible from the outside, but they still broke in (guess some people are really desperate). I have now learned my lesson to never leave cash inside my car and my faith in my fellow Vancouverites has gone down just a lil

I have an actual confession to make. I am currently studying environmental law and I preach sustainability and environmental stewardship whenever I can, but I daily drive a stacked and lifted Dodge Ram 2500 with the diesel Cummins engine that spews thick black sooty smoke everytime I step on the gas pedal. Even worse, I live right by the 49 bus line so even though I could take the bus and reduce my carbon footprint, I choose not to because I like the comforts of my truck. I know it makes me look like a massive hypocrite but this Dodge is a vehicle I have wanted for a long time and driving a Prius just doesn't garner the same amount of respect and presence on the road.

In one of my classes, we have weekly quizzes that are 50% individual and 50% group. The groups were randomly assigned in the beginning but somehow my group is me and 4 other people from SUS. When we were doing the group portion, let me just say that HOLY FUCK THEY'RE THE MOST CONDESCENDING PEOPLE I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE. I legit can't give any suggestions because they're so protective of their ideas just like fucking white knights for big titty streamers. Jokes on them, their answers were wrong. 🙃

I'm finishing up a year long exchange in Australia and my biggest takeaway is that UBC academic culture is RUINING all of our lives. Nobody here is stressing over finding internships and planning the next 20 years of their lives after they graduate... I've spent so many sleepless nights trying to figure out what I'm doing with my arts degree and if I'm wasting time or not and it's so fucked!!! Why can't we just relax like they do here and in Europe and be normal students for a change?? They can open as many 'wellness' centers as they want on campus but it won't change the ultra competitive culture in north american universities that's driving us insane!!!

Is anyone else absolutely ENRAGED at the atrocity committed to the 4 & 5 floors at koerners??? Where are the private carrels next to the window??? Do I have to actually sit across from people now with nothing dividing us?!? And no desks with a view??? Who can study in an arm chair? It seems like UBC wants us to interact with each other well I AM NOT HAVING IT

The Nest, 3:55pm, a day like any other.
I walk, I don’t notice, that you’re there waiting for me in truth. In fact I do, but I know, I can’t keep doing more of you. One more time, I breath, I notice of you this time you’re there. I think, I question, I remember you, who else. I look back, I imagine, the beauty of you being in my hands. I walk towards you, I breath again, your smell. I see you on the other side of the glass and tell you make time pass by. I breath, I c...

I sometimes wonder if the architects/building designers were high when they were making the blueprints. Why the FUCK would you add keypad access to the upper floors in the stairwells but not have it in the elevators?

While some people think UBC is an accepting community, I have never felt so rejected and isolated today. I appreciate the promotion of the LGBTQ+ community as I am a member of that community, but UBC has overlooked the discrimination that occurs among different majors within the same faculty.

For those who are not in science or applied science, science students get their major in second year; the most popular choices require a higher average. In my lab section today, ...

Litsa Rethimiotakis I'm a third year bio student at UBC and I never really noticed this sort of behaviour. I wanted to do bio because that's what most interested me, not because I didn't have a high enough average for anything else. If those people are really like that to you then they're not worth befriending 🤷‍♀️

Ray Shi Damn, I used to have a roommate who's now 3rd year I guess, he has been coughing like that since the first day he moved in. I have asked few times to check with the doctor and he always said "I'm fine", and I even talked with his mom about how annoying it is to me and the other roommates, and his crazy mom said it was totally fine. Please, if you are having unusual problem go check with the doc.

Ever since I moved into my room I’ve had to keep my blinds down. Because every 👏🏽 fucking 👏🏽 time I pull them up, I can see a couple in the building right across my room going at it like animals, I’m talking real INTENSE stuff, with their blinds WIDE OPEN. My dudes, no one is happier for you than me, do what you gotta do, but pls keep the blinds down so I don’t feel like a weirdo every time I look out my window.

Upper year student here. To all first years, you may think uni is all about partying, enjoying and drinking. Trust me, none of you have felt the pleasure of a good nap 💤 . That’s basically 80% of uni life. Well that and constantly failing and being broke.

This might sound kinda petty but I think it matters. I'm pretty sure part of their mandates is to promote inclusivity (and if it's not, YOIKES), but check out the photos from their events. White/white-washed people. Conventionally attractive people....

Some context: I graduated from UBC in May and am currently working. I was looking at my social media this week and I saw all the stories and snaps about classes starting again and I couldn't help but miss being in school. All my friends who are still studying have sent me snaps and posted stuff on their Instagrams about how class is already boring and stuff but I'll tell you now, the world after you finish school is also boring. Probably even more boring to be honest. Looking back, my four years at UBC are probably the most fun and memorable years of my life. If I could choose to be in schol, I'd do so in a heartbeat. So I guess what I want to say is to all of you still studying at UBC, have an amazing school year!

So apparently my english course is just chock full of hilariously oblivious love confessions. Two DIFFERENT guys hinted that they liked a girl (the same one) through our group chat but the girl didn’t realize either of them was a confession. The girl ended up dropping out of the class and now the guys are best friends.

It was so warm during the first week of school and so I wanted to wear my fav summer outfit: high-waist shorts, crop top, jacket. BUT I was nervous to wear this outfit because I am no six-pack chick, and I know no one would say anything about that if I wore the outfit, but I still felt a bit nervous to wear it so I buttoned my jacket and headed out.

When I got to campus though, I saw many ladies (six-pack or not!) sporting crop tops and at this I was heartened so I unbuttoned my jean jacket and decided to rock that mid-body (above belly-button/below boobs) along with all the other crop-top ladies of the day.

I stayed for 3 years even though I would never join my school club's mock committees and would just sign up for conferences. Of course I never got any awards.

Year 1 APSC commuting from Richmond:

Yeah, I'm gonna take my RAV to the 49..

#11996

Is it just me or did none of the first years this year learn any manners about being in public transit because it's absolutely appalling. Not only do they seem to have never heard of the term 'indoor voices,' they also DO NOT MOVE to the BACK of the bus, which is extremely frustrating when drivers are trying to be on schedule during peak hours to and from UBC. I literally witnessed a group of first years sit in the disabled area and not move when a disabled person got on, and the driver had to GET OUT OF HIS SEAT and tell them off. I'm sure there's first years out there who behave properly in public and not like a fucking animal, but to the ones who don't - you're making the reputation of first years even worse.

Who the FUCK designed the swing space building? They should be tried for crimes against architecture. It's a goddamn mess on West mall every time that clock hits X:50.

If you're going to put a bigass lecture hall on the second floor it's pretty obvious you should install more than one tiny set of stairs. I really don't look forward to a regularly scheduled M/W/F traffic jam for the rest of the semester. If there were a fire in that building people definitely die. To t...

Greek system is low-key racist y'all

Set the scene: after I was offered a bid, an older member of my sorority asked me what I was? I was confused and asked her what she meant. She aggressively said that it was very clear that I wasn't white.When I told her my ethnicity she made racist comments that I didn't have the stereotypically features of someone my race. as the year progressed her clique continued to make me feel like an outsider and treat me differently.

This morning I was taking the 44 to UBC and to my surprise Gateman gets on the bus at Nelson St with an industrial grade furniture dolly. He sat down in the priority seating area with his newly acquired industrial grade furniture dolly and proceed to look at everyone on the bus individually to determine their value in the world. At MacDonald St. a young couple boarded the bus with their stroller and young child and headed towards where Gateman was sitting. Most people ...

I have one course that I still need in order to graduate, but this term it is only being offered in the room where I fucked my ex, and I miss him so much I refuse to enter that building again. the last time I did i broke down in the bathroom so basically I won't be graduating for an extra year until this course is moved somewhere else because love fucking sucks.

"When I start university, I'm definitely gonna keep on top of everything! I'm gonna get good grades, meet new friends and just really enjoy the experience. I can't wait to see what life has in store for me!" - A (possibly over-exaggerated) common saying by First-Years, including me

TW: Mental health

Hello I’m a third year and due to poor mental health I had a terrible winter semester. It was so bad I was required to withdraw. Now the month I was supposed to graduate is when I can reapply. I hate this, even though I was in contact with the centre of accessibility I felt like no one was on my side or believed in me. I’ve never felt so alone. There was no warning, I know I’m grown enough to be able to take care of myself. Counselling at school sucks...

The fact that she even cared to talk about it with you doesn't seem malicious to me.

I know people say that Vanier isn’t that bad and that first years are overreacting but I got Vanier in my first year and it was horrible! The community in my building was shit, it was so dark and gloomy in there all the time, and I hated living there. I had some friends in orchard and totem and I know I would’ve had a better time if I had been assigned one of those. So yes, your Rez does impact your first experience significantly and anyone who tries to deny it just hasn’t experienced that kind of bad luck yet

“Moot or noot” is the name of the messenger group chat for first year law students on messenger (I know! Real classy for our prestigious degree). With almost 100 members, for the past couple of days some students have been trying to beat each other in basketball and football. I think its time to stop. Show your superiority in law school. Leave the chat for communications regarding law! The notifications are very annoying and have nothing to do with the purpose of the chat. You are law students. You are supposed to be intellectuals. Don't you have readings to do? On be half of every other law student who is in that group chat. We just wanna survive torts.

Some comments in recent posts concerning the Hong Kong protests combined with the recent counterprotests in Vancouver, however, have made me feel especially sad.

One of the books is from the UBC library. I heard about the fact that you can renew books at the UBC library for an infinite period of time - provided that no one were to request the bo...

Seeing as how the "Free Speech" club is promising even bigger events this year, I thought it would be helpful to remind everyone of the types of people they want to invite to our campus. I strongly believe that Canadians should have the right to express themselves freely without government interference, but you can't invite someone who spouts racial IQ theories and blames mass shootings on "third world immigrants", and then play the victim when people call you out for ...

Jordan Kostaschuk It's almost like the free speech club genuinely advocates for free speech, but they can't invite anyone on the left because there are so few leftists that support an unfettered freedom of speech and all that's left are far right conservatives.

I love wearing dresses, skirts, lingerie, heels and much more. There is just something about dressing feminine that makes my heart go and sometimes I wear these things in public, but not often.

Sometimes I do wish a female (like a gf) would dominate me and push me to be (and dress) more feminine in public....

I am freaking out. I got Vanier basement for my first year residence. How is that fair to me? My friends have stopped talking to me and started making friends with people in their own buildings. I don't even know who my roommate is. Everyone said Vanier would be the worst thing to happen to me and I am so sad right now. I think I will end up not coming to the university at all or better yet I should just die.
Why could they not have given me Orchard Commons or Totem Park. I applied so early and I had good grades then why am I stuck with this? Does UBC housing have any answers? Should I just die?

Nayoung Jin I met the nicest friend/person in my life, when I stayed in Vanier. That was only way I could meet her, I think. And you are saving a huge amount of money by staying in a dorm. If you feel claustrophobic, stay in libraries, Nest, and commons area as often as you can. It won't be too bad. :) don't you even have a cafeteria close by? seems like you have a decent environment to study.

As a Civil Engineering student, I sometimes wonder what it would feel like to fuck freshly poured concrete. You would need to finish pretty quick and your pullout game has to be on point though.

This happened a while ago, and initially I thought it didn't matter, but I think with recent events, it is more relevant than ever. And sorry if it's long.

I was talking to a (Caucasian) busker down town. He told me of his travels around the world and then he asked me where I was from. I honestly didn't think much of him and told him I was raised here, that I was Canadian. I thought he was nice and so I thought he would be more open minded. And I would like to make a d...

I can never imagine that the protest in HK has impacted emotionally this much. It is so sad to see that HK people have to fight this hard for justice and rule of law. It is even sadder to see how this protest has divided HK people from many people from Mainland China. Few weeks ago, a random SFU girl from Mainland China has contacted me on facebook, asking me to join their protest against HK students in Vancouver. Perhaps, she can see that I am from the Mainland from m...

UBC Computer Science is not spending money in the right areas oh my fuck. If you want to UBC comp sci to be attractive to people. Fucking blow money into co-op, there's a reason why Waterloo comp sci is so attractive. We don't have Microsoft even though they have an office in Vancouver, and the Amazon posting just tells you to go apply on their website. What a shit show. Learn something from Waterloo's co-op. They prioritize students instead of companies.

UBC vs UCB

The worst part about not being at school for the summer is the utter lack of good dick in my hometown. I've either (a) seen the dicks and def would never go back to them (b) the dicks belong to my friend's family members and I'm not fucking with that or (c) the dicks are on avid trump supporters. August needs to come faster (pun fully intended) :(

UBC Computer Science is one of the most disorganized faculties at UBC. How in the world do you maintain 300 and more students while each core course only has 2 sections. It's a gamble to even get into your classes. And before you virgins come on here with the usual "get better grades" shit, save it because core students are obligated to get into and complete their core courses. Why even give the specialization if that's not the case? Straight disrespectful. UBC has been managing the demand increase terribly but I guess ugrads don't matter in the grand scheme of things. If I had known that this was what I was signing up for I wouldn't bother registering

I hate to admit it but I find my younger sister cute and attractive. She fits literally everything I am looking for in an ideal girlfriend : sweet personality, supportive, cute and athletic looking, east Asian, nice legs. Sometimes I just scroll through her Vsco or Instagram to admire her looks. Her boyfriend is such a lucky guy to have such an appealing girlfriend and I really hope to finally be a boyfriend to someone this next school year

I once was so desperate for a relationship that I agreed to help a girl, whom I had just matched on Tinder, with completing her English assignment.

I'd spend time clarifying the assignment criteria with her, offering her my ideas while critiquing her own, editing and proofreading multiple rough drafts, adding to and formatting the essay, providing feedback, and generally doing my best to ensure that her essay could get a respectable mark....

So I’m back home for summer break. I identify as mostly homosexual, and while I don’t keep it a secret from others, I’m not openly out to most people. Now, my country is not exactly homophobic but the heteronormativity is pretty strong here and some of the conversations I have here really make me miss Vancouver and its queer-friendly culture. It’s like people over here don’t even consider the possibility of you not being straight unless you’re very Camp Gay.

I am writing this confession right before I'm about to go meet my prof, probably going to end up sleeping with her. My hands are literally sweaty because I haven't told my friends about our flirtatious emails back and fourth, nor have I told them that I'm about to go meet her in smack dab middle of nowhere for "dinner and some drinks." I didn't even know this sleeping with profs thing was a real thing, but I guess it is. So my advice for those who find their profs even the slightest bit sexy, just email them an innocent question or some bullshit about their course. Before you know it, you'll find yourself trying to seduce someone with the best Sauder snake email writing skills you have.This is why I am so grateful for UBCC honestly I have no idea how I could get this off my chest otherwise.

So i’ve been cross dressing off and on for most of my life but recently it’s turned into this huge identity crisis. I want to try living as a girl or just going further with the dressing. But i’ve never started in on make up and i wouldn’t know where to start and an honestly scared shitless about buying some. I feel like i’ll be judged buying make up as a guy. And scared at the end of the day i might not “pass” i feel like i fit neither description. I’m not a manly man, and i’m scared i’m not femme enough to pass. Is there anyone or anywhere that could help me with the idea of transitioning or even figuring any of this out ?

The fact that there are people who register for popular required courses that already don't have enough seats for the sole purpose of selling them to people who actually need to take them has cemented my belief that a good portion of students have no integrity whatsoever. Y'all are money hungry and selfish f*cks

I pray to Senior Planner Facility Planning every night, thanking him for the life I’ve been given. “Transit is love” I say, “Transit is life." My dad heard me and calls me an NUMTOT. I knew he was just jealous of my devotion to transit. I called him a Kevin Desmond because he doesn't have the dedication or as rich as him. He hits me and sends me to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. ...

Tanya Paz This is so good. If the transit police instead asked "What is Braid Station (and does it exist)?" it would be perfect.

So, I just accidentally unsubscribed from the grad student society emails. Why? The sent an email that looked like it was from the "Free Speech Club." It appeared FSC was trying to be proactive by informing all students that they didn't meeeeen to cause dangerous situations around campus, it was just that people with free thoughts can sometimes do things the reeeeeest of society deeems bad. The email then went on to give resources for those felt endangered. It was so snarky and full of themselves. It was as if these kids just left their parents' basements and thought this would be good enough to prevent legal action if something happened.

I'm really worried about submitting original content to UBC Confessions. I am not sure if we're allowed to submit non-stolen content and am just wondering if anyone else has experience with this sort of issue. What submissions of yours were approved? What did you submit instead?

I am a lesbian and my closest friends (who are all female) have no idea. There are a number of reasons why I have decided to remain in the closet. Firstly, while I don't think any of them are particularly homophobic, there is a part of me that is certain that once I tell them, things will get subtly awkward between us (i.e conscious hugging). Secondly, I have gotten so good at acting straight that I even got into the habit of checking out random guys in front of them....

So in my house we have this puppy, and she's still learning how to be house trained. She has to go out every 3 hours to pee, and if i let her out and don't take her outside immediately, she pees on the floor. Last night, around 3am, she wakes me up by yelping and barking and trying to get out. I go out with her, and am preparing to take her out when I feel the urgent pressure on my bladder telling me that I needed to go just as badly. Now I couldn't exactly go outside ...

Trigger Warning

My close friend is going through major bouts of depression and self harm. They’re in the process of getting the help they need, but having them on my mind, and making sure they are safe every minute of the day is slowly eating at my own mental health. I feel that can’t say anything though because it’s clear that they are having it worse than I am, and it’ll cause them to plummet even further.

Another fun fact from your favourite admin: UBC Confessions, shockingly, is not Academic Advising. We cannot tell you how to get into UBC nor about requirements for graduation. Stop asking us. It is trivially easy to type the exact same thing into an email to advising (or maybe not, based on the stupidity of some of your questions).

*Warning for people who don't like periods and women's period products*

I legit had the biggest heart attack last night. So I just started my full time summer job, and at the same time my period started. To hide this, I used a tampon (I'm not getting into a debate about which one is better to use, I personally prefer them over other products). Later on when I got home that night, I went to take it out before I went to bed. As I went to remove it, the string just came s...

Hello guys! I am a student from University Hill Secondary school just south of the campus. I would just like to take this time to make a confession about UBC. I’m not a UBC student, but I have been freeloading and leeching off of UBC facilities since 2014. Using the spaces to study, libraries to read books without borrowing them, and free internet to prep AP, I thought I could be a parasite forever. But, all good things come to an end. I’m graduating high school, and UBC got the last laugh as my tuition fees are used to develop drugs that cure parasitic infections. I cannot be a parasite for much longer... I will miss these days. Sigh....

I would like to share a story with you. It is a story that is close to my heart, so I beg you for some patience and some sympathy.

I went to a party, and the host owned a cat. The cat was very beautiful, as many cats are. As we lounged in his living room, I commented on the pet and asked if it was usually amenable to physical touch from people. The host replied, “Yes”, and followed with, almost as an afterthought, deadpan with mirth tickling the corners of his eyes, “...

She is making a real difference and I don’t think she knows it. I don’t think she knows how amazing her lectures are or how great her teaching is. Am not gonna lie, she’s great looking too. Thank you Dr ? for reminding me why I’m at UBC and why this whole place is so fucked up. I love you.

I’m a girl, graduating this year and have never been in a relationship, other than very short/meaningless guys I “dated” from back in high school. I never really questioned why I wasn’t putting myself out there, just figured I didn’t have enough time or wasn’t really interested in a relationship at this point in my life. A few weeks ago a thought creeped into my head that I might actually be lesbian (never really considered it before). It kind of makes sense retrospectively. I’m sort of freaking out now though, I don’t even know how to test(?) out this curiosity or if I should even talk to someone about it. How do lesbians even meet anyway????? Give me advice please

As I see a lot of my friends graduating, and a lot of their families coming to be a part of it, I begin to get worried. Next year, that'll be me, and lots of my family will be coming to attend. It's not that I don't want my family to come here; I just worry that the secrets I've been keeping from them—that I've been having sex, drinking occasionally, not keeping up with religion—will find their way to the surface. I'm not ready for that.

Personally, I do not see anything wrong with selling grad tixs for $90+. Face value is $2 apparently. When there is so much demand, why can't I exploit the people who desperately need it? This world is cruel- trust no one. I will not be afraid to exploit anyone for the sake of my loved ones. This world is HARSH and one must do whatever they can to support themselv...

i experienced sushi a couple days ago and i think im in love <33 i get even happier knowing vancouver is full of sushi joints, whatta treat. my only qualm is about the bc roll. vancouver sushi is amazing, yet how is this the namesake roll of bc. fish skin does NOT belong in sushi, and certainly does not deserve the title of bc roll. preach with me ppl, rename that god awful roll. newcomers like me will try the bc roll here and get put off sushi forever. thank god my friends are persisent. spread the word all, rename the bc roll

I was TAing this one class with a pretty harsh curve. I was told that I had to stand my ground when grading and not to waver when students inevitably ask for higher marks. So I graded one students paper who wasn't fulfilling all the criteria (albeit there wasn't much of a rubric). They had messaged me and were practically guilt tripping me to give them a higher mark. Saying stuff like having an extremely high average and if they even get a *slightly* lower mark that they couldn't get into their graduate program. After I had declined and told them to talk to the Prof they messaged me again implying a trade of sorts. They had basically told me they would give me n00ds in exchange for a higher mark. I won't tell you if I accepted or not but they did get in the top percentile of the class.

TLDR: I almost drunkenly puked my guts out all over Gateman.

In first term I showed up to ECON 101 with gateman absolutely hammered, he totally knew and was having an issue with his microphone and called me up to help him fix it (to be fair it was a 4pm lecture on a Friday and I was going to a party after, I shouldn’t have even attempted to go to class, nobody should do this, my judgement was heavily impaired and I did it for shits and giggles). I proceeded to clumsily...

My mean strict dick professor that I was scarred of asking for him to give way for me to leave because he’s such a mean and scary person and gets annoyed really easily even when you ask questions. So I figured I would go when he goes especially since he drank a glass of beer. But NO. He didn’t get up to go once for our flight to Japan that I held my pee in from Alaska (I had...

So I am born in Canada and do not look my ethnicity at all. I am constantly mistaken for being "white" or mixed, but I'm far from it. As a result, I have never experienced discrimination based off my ethnicity before. That was until now. I was on the phone with a government service attempting to figure out some miscommunications. My full name is very ethnic and over the phone the lady was already being quite rude but asked me "well how long have you been in Canada for?...

Finding the right person, that perfect person. Like most of you, its something I'd been looking for, and only recently did I finally realize how much that ideal is actually hurting my chances of finding a good relationship.

Almost 2 years ago, I made the leap to go out to talk to more people and expand my social circle. After a year, I felt empowered - I'd talked to enough people to be able to quickly tell whether someone has that "resonance" with me, that feeling of...

As a female in STEM, I have many burdens. Many of those burdens are inherent to the politics of operating within a climate that doesn’t always make me feel welcome. I’ve spent a lot of energy learning about the injustices that I experience (and will experience) daily in my education and career, and that includes re-learning what it means to love myself as a female. Spending extensive time within/around many males who harbored less than favorable views on women gave me ...

Lachlan Byrnes OP the 233 "tutorials" in the fall were unofficial and run by the fantastic Walid, a grad student who went seriously above and beyond in his instruction of the course. The Chem 233 teaching team is deciding whether they want to implement them as an official part of the course. For now, I would suggest getting your hands on a copy of someone's notes from his tutorials/exam prep sessions. They are pure gold.

Check out period is a stressful period for all. There's thousands of students moving out but also thousands moving in. While it may not always seem this way, as housing staff, we do try our best to help with all issues that arise. But sometimes there's only so much we can do. You'll likely become frustrated with us, and that's understandable. However, that doesn't make it excusable to be a dick, to berate staff or threaten us with physical violence, which happens more often than you may think. You'd only be alienating the people who want to help. Help us help you.

So I came out to my dad sometime last year and after a bit of time he seemed to be okay with it. I was pretty worried because his parents are very religious and would in no way accept me if I came out to them - so I was okay with him never mentioning it if it meant he was semi-ok with it. But I just got home and found a Bible in the office with only one section bookmarked with a sticky note - the section about sexual sins. I don't know if I'm reading too much into this or not but now I don't know if he truly accepted my sexuality, or just choose to overlook it because I'm his kid. I don't know how to bring this up to him or any of my friends ...

I was working on my laptop in Irving and I was feeling frustrated so I let out a sigh through my nose. Without warning, a bunch of snot flew out of my nose and onto my laptop. I do not think anyone saw, but I can still see them, these blobs of snot on my laptop. It has been about two minutes and I have not touched them...maybe I will just let them dry and be a reminder of frustration whenever I open my laptop.

Now that I'm paying per fare I'm really realizing how great student upass was to me. Wana bum it to Burnaby? Not a chance bro, that shit costs money now I can't move without purpose.

I blew $200 on laundry this year because my friends keep parking their nasty ass OUTSIDE CLOTHES on my bed and I have to change my sheets every goddamn time it happens and it happens so often. They are genuinely nice people and I don’t want to repeatedly confront them about it because I don’t want to be an asshole but damn everytime i put my sheets in the laundry machine because of this a little piece of me dies inside. I knew I’d be in debt in college but I didn’t realize that I would go broke due to mf LAUNDRY.

I never thought I would be this emotional as a stoic introvert guy but today my favorite younger sister created LinkedIn for her first job and it teared me up a bit realizing she’s growing up and becoming independent. I love her and care about her and want her to succeed that’s why I was happy to answer her questions on creating a good profile but I was crying on the inside when I was helping her. She means everything to me.

- There are 16,322 international students at UBC, more than 25% of the entire school population.
- There are two advisors that can give you limited advice before you can talk to a full advisor for … 16,322 people. ...

The stalls including unisex ones can be so gross to touch and the weird semi circle U shape seats on toilet leaving the Center exposed to pee dribble from other men was disgusting.

It absolutely made my day!! Thank you so much! I tried to send an image back on airdrop but couldn’t find you. Little things like this mean so much. Hope you’re studying well and to everyone good luck for the last few days!

On April 11th 2019 at 2:55pm I entered the men's washroom in Neville Scarfe. One of the reasons I prefer studying at Neville Scarfe is that the bathroom is always empty and clean, so imagine my surprise when I walked in to see you standing in my stall of choice. You in your brown leather shoes, you were standing there like a tiger awaiting his prey. I took the far stall so I wouldn't be next to you and quickly got to business. All the coffee I drank as I studied had gi...

I am very much actually addicted to weed. I know people think it's not possible, but it is in a low number of cases. You can also develop a psychological dependency on it. Anytime I have a lot of free time to myself, meaning I'm not running to appointments or meetings of any sort, I start smoking more weed. In the case of finals, when I no longer have classes to go to which fill my weeks and give me purpose, and am instead given loads of time to study, I e...

Okay, call me crazy, but maybe some amount of theft isn't the worst thing. I know, but hear me out. I'm currently on exchange at another institution which requires your student card to get into and out of the library, so only students ever occupy it. Perhaps partially as a result, theft seems non-existent, people leave their laptops on their desks while they go to the washroom, phones on chairs, full purses and bags, everything. Seems great, right? Well. Right now I am...

Marcelo Gaia funny how some people are so scared of conflict that they believe theft is a better option of saying "oh hi, your bag was there for a while, so I moved so people could sit down." and deal with whatever the person has to say. Time to grow up people. You're not doing anything wrong.

The worst part about going into an final exam knowing that I’m gonna fail the course isn’t the F on my transcript, or the wasted money; it’s seeing the proud look on my girlfriend’s face afterwards when I tell her that “it went well”, knowing inside that I’ve disappointed her, and that in a few weeks when the grades are released she’ll see the truth. 😞

tldr: accidentally exposed my girlfriend and i's sex life to her parents

This weekend, my girlfriend’s parents invited me over for dinner to meet me. Dinner went well and I made a good impression on her parents, especially her dad who was intrigued by my interest in coding and writing programs. After dinner, we were all in the living room and he asked to see some of my projects and I excitedly agreed, making the biggest mistake of my life of opening my laptop and showing him. My girlfriend and I had recently recorded a video of us getting steamy and I had opened it this morning... and left it open. So, by opening my laptop her dad and mom heard her moaning in full volume and her dad saw me pounding her... in full 1080p. Now I'm back in my apartment, my girlfriend won't talk to me, and I'm contemplating my life.

I really wish people would play more tame and ambient music at parties. I'm not trying to rip anyone's personal taste in music. I just really struggle socially because I have a very quiet voice and very poor hearing. It really sucks that I have to be inches from people's face to properly be in a conversation.

There's gotta be some kind of sound filter that mutes the human vocal range so that people's voices don't get drowned out? Is there such a thing?

My boyfriend and I started spamming each other with emails because we were literally THAT bored this finals season so then we started signing each other to weird irrelevant mailing lists ( the kind that send you 20 emails a day).

After he signed me up to men's grooming products I maybe took it a step too far by signing him up to a ton of PORN (because I am just the coolest girlfriend ever). Anyway so we met that evening and I thought we were going to have some really h...

A message from people that always complain about their workloads. We don’t do it because we want to impress you. We do it because we’re overwhelmed and we’re feeling a lot of things and we have a lot of stuff to do and it would be nice to have someone to talk to about and maybe a hug. That is all.

A message from the government of Canada. Doo doo da doo.

When people ask "can you watch my stuff for a second?" in the library, I usually hide it under the table, chair, bench, etc. and leave. My only regret in doing this is I wish I could stick around to see their look of terror when they come back and don't immediately see their computer... It's the small things.

I remember that almost four years ago, I was so happy when I received my letter of acceptance to UBC Medicine. I thought I was going to be able to pursue my path to becoming a great doctor. I wanted to work hard to learn as much and be the best medical student that I can be.

Now, four years later, I feel that I have failed my preceptors, patients, classmates, and most importantly myself. I feel so stupid every single day and feel like I shouldn't have being admitted into medical school. I think the UBC Med Admissions Committee must have mixed up my profile with another candidate's four years ago and I got in by fluke.

Ellah Turiano YOU got into med school and you clearly deserved it as you seemed to have so much ambition and drive in the beginning. Everyone hits this point in their academic career, but honestly you’ve already come so far. Keep working hard and finish strong. That’s the only thing that’ll matter in the end. Good luck and I look forward to your success as a doctor. ☺️

Exam season is hard. I study at IKB from morning until night - I bust my ass to the 4th floor hallway tables, and stay there until 2-3 in the morning.

I’m not a coffee drinker, nor do I take stimulants to help me study; I’m all natural, 100% hard work. But I do one thing - I jerk off 6-7 times a day....

I had the biggest panic attack one evening last term when I stepped into the shower realizing I could have mixed up 7pm final exam for 17:00, which would have been 5pm.. at 5:05 I got in the shower... 4 seconds in with one leg still dry, I literally almost shit myself upon stumbling across this thought....

I just wanted to give a little reminder to pay attention to your friends, especially if it's a birthday or other special event.

It was my birthday not too long ago. I wasn't expecting anything special because I normally keep it relatively low key, knowing most people are busy with exams or work and the rest of their lives. This year though, since it's my last year at UBC, I decided to invite all my friends out to have a dinner. I let them know that I knew people were ...

That's the problem with people. I wish for the best, Happy Birthday.

Bin Yin I think a problem with degrees like this is that their recognition is not yet proven (notwithstanding the prestige associated with UBC). Data science is an emerging field. Right now, you don’t even need a degree in DS to be a data scientist, as I was told – you can actually study the subject yourself by taking online courses. But things may change. Who knows.

This school year, I stole items from the residence dining hall about half the times I ate there. I live in totem, and I go to either feast or open kitchen to eat. The items that I usually steal are soft drinks, desserts, milk, and sometimes even chicken stripes. Each item is about 3-8 dollars, the total amount adds up to at least 600 dollars.

I am confessing this because I feel guilty for not stealing more. I know a lot of people are doing this because they're tired of the overpriced food here and don't know any other way to protest. I definitely understand that my behaviour will not stop them from charging us ridiculous prices (in fact this will probably make it worse), but I really don't care what will happen to the students next year, this is just my way to get even-steven.

The absolute worst student politicians are the ones that say "if you want to make a change, you should get involved" because they can't seem to take any criticism.

This usually happens when a student society has a serious issue with exclusivity and shitty event organization. Let me just say there are plenty of student organizations who've been able to improve how inclusive they are and there are plenty of first-time event organizers who organize killer events. The issu...

You know, I always find that when the class claps for the professor at the end of the term bittersweet. It's like for one, yes good job professor you've taught us so much and inspired us to learn so much more. But also, thank the lord that this shitty class is over, but I'm clapping for you because I want you to recognize my face and give me a better mark on my final exam, because I'm barely passing this course.

The spike in posts concerning substance abuse and suicide demonstrate exactly why a page like UBC Confessions is needed. There's so much stigma about these topics and people often feel like they're suffering alone. Nothing could be further than the truth. It's a stressful time for everyone when exams are near, so if you haven't reached out to a friend or haven't checked in a while, do so! If you see a stranger crying in the library ask them how they're doing. Not to be dramatic or anything, but you very well could save someone's life in that moment.

Best of luck to the (mostly!) wonderful community here on UBC Confessions!

Ever since I was a kid I've always had an irrational fear of something(one?) hiding behind my shower curtain so I always open it before going about my business in the bathroom.

So my sleep deprived self just walked into the bathroom, ripped it back and yelled "nOT TODAY, GOBLINS!". As the sound of that echoed around my empty apartment I caught a glance of myself in the mirror and took a good, long look at myself....

So I went to go use a porta potty at Block Party. Opened the door and found a couple having full on sex inside and THEY DIDNT EVEN STOP OR FLINCH ONE BIT WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR! I just got told to fuck off while watching this dude slam his dick into this girl, then they slammed the door and kept on going. Those potties smell like actual shit I don’t know how you people do it.

Y’all are falling for the government’s trap; they want you to believe in mountains so you don’t realize that the Canadian government cooperated with the Americans to help make you believe that we are indeed, free.

Trigger Warning

As someone who attempted suicide in October 2018, I just wanted to say how awful it is in the VGH ER. I was transferred there from the UBC hospital due to the absolute joke that is UBC mental health. Despite being in considerable psychological distress, I was left to wait in a chair for hours in a dingy corridor because of the fucking joke that is Canadian health care with no food or water or phone. I was forced to put on hideous, oversize, pajamas, that clearly marked me as a psychiatric patient to the others, which was humiliating. Even if I attempt suicide once again, I feel like I don't ever want to go to a hospital ever again to seek treatment.

UBC should offer more online courses. The amount of courses I have taken both within and outside my own faculty, which can be run online, is quiet significant.
Online courses are more practical for poor commuter students and students who need to work during school. A significant number of domestic students and a handful of international students are in this situation. Online courses could be offered at much lower price, decreasing tuition prices, as well as enable more people to pursue a degree. It can help people with disabilities and mobility issues. Exams can still be run on campus. There is no negative outcome in making education more affordable and accessible.

This is my last week of school as a UBC undergrad, and it still amazes me how students here go to libraries just for socializing. Why are you even speaking or whispering your entire conversations in the silent study spaces?

I've been to many universities around the world in different countries in US, UK etc. and NEVER have I ever heard students chatting loudly in libraries - if they do at all. They would be courteous and step outside and bring the conversation somewher...

Opinion poll here. I'm not sure how I feel about this, but I just found out my friend only eats cereal and milk. ONLY those two things, three times a day, everyday. No chicken, no veggies, no nuts, no chocolate. Only cereal and milk 7 days a week. The only thing that changes is the brands from Cheerio's to Vector, and the different milks from the standard, to cashew to nut based milks.Coming from a perspective of someone who eats three balanced meals a day, I cannot fathom at how his body functions. Like we got the two food groups covered, dairy and grains, but what about proteins and fats and all the different vitamins. Please someone send him a cookbook, or a girlfriend he can go shopping with!!! He's a nice guy, just with poor food choices.

Judging by the low voter turnout in the AMS election, a large majority of students are been tryanised by the minority of students that did vote. Isn't the entire purpose of voting is that every single student get to have a say but due to our lack of participation, we are essentially being held hostage by the small group of students that did vote.

The shit happening at the AMS is entirely due to our lack of participation, allowing candidates to run away with corruptio...

Dan Gonzalez Make AMS membership optional, just like in Ontario. If people see value in the AMS and they want to pay 800 CAD or so for it fine, but don't make everyone subsidize that thing. :)

I lie to everyone I meet and tell them that I come from China (but actually I’m not) so they’ll be amazed and say “omg your English is good” or “damn you’re the most white washed Chinese I know.” Until today, none of my friends in UBC know my real identity. Trying to see if this can last all four years.

tl;dr UBC's Master of Data Science is really a crappy program.

We had a professor in our lab who was involved in the design of the UBC’s Master of Data Science program. During a lab meeting, he told us all the darkness behind the program. Apparently the program is designed without much approval from the professors in the statistics program. For those who don’t know, the program is only 10-month long. Given the short length of the program, of course, you can’t get prop...

I'm a first year student in a professional program, and let me just say - the conduct of some of the upper years is sickening. Well, a few in particular. My program is a very stressful and difficult one, especially in first year, and there are a few guys in second year who swarm around the first years like flies to shit. One in particular has made it his mandate to provide "advice" and "guidance" about how to do well in this program, when really his main goal is to get...

You. Yes you with the 90+ overall GPA. Don't think you're fooling anyone with that smile towards us inferior beings. I know you're smiling not out of pity or sympathy, but rather the fact that we exist as your GPA booster. People speak of courses for GPA boosting, but in reality it's the people like us who ride the low left of the bell curve which you surf ahead upon. Nobody should be fooled by your actions or appearance when in reality you are looking down at us, the base of the pyramid so you could be in the top echelon. Hah! You think you fooled me, nice try Joker.

p.s. If your overall is 93+, even less excusable, you think we are not even worthy to be stepped on as you only sit at the top. We as mere fleas are not even worth a thought.

As a Muslim on campus I was deeply offended by what happened during the vigil ceremony for the New Zealand shooting victims. The songs, performance is not part of an Islamic culture and I have never seen a vigil like this where people are promoting their own brand and not actually talking about the victims.

I was hurt to see that no one prayed for the elevation of their status, for the forgiveness of their sins, for the easement of suffering that their families are go...

Dan Gonzalez In pracrical terms you have 0 legal rights when living on campus, a couple of years ago there was a movement to have student housing covered by the RTA but UBC lobbied against it. I don’t think applying the RTA is doable for student housing but students should have some sort of legal protection.

Some of you domestic students need to fucking realize not every international student is rich. Not all of us are privileged. Yea we're dependent on our parents, but what do you expect? That we can work full time, and study at the same time, and just be able to pay up 40K a year (just tuition btw)? Grow some fucking brain cells. And just because our parents are able to pay that much money in tuition doesn't automatically mean we're rich. Almost all of that money comes f...

Sure, this doesn't always happen with all guys I work with, and never with other girls.

Can we for a moment just be so thankful that in Canada there’s no such thing as paid washrooms? Europe on exchange is killing my tiny bladder and wallet. I have spent more than $10 on peeing on bad days including $3-4 to pee at a park in Norway alone. How do you Europeans live with paying just to pee? This should be a human right to go for free! And why do men get free street urinals in Amsterdam and Brussels?
As much as I like exchange I can’t wait to pee for free again in Vancouver and not holding it so I have budget for lunch and dinner.

Zahra Al-Autman Honestly I usually just walk into a busy McDonalds or a Starbucks and it’s usually fine. Or I’ll go to a public place (like a shopping centre) and there are usually free washrooms there. Or you can always ask restaurants nicely and sometimes they’ll say yes. Or walk into a hostel or hotel like you belong and use the lobby washroom 🤷🏽‍♀️ and if all else fails, bring tissue packs with you and pop a squat

2) For the gotdam amount of work I've put in you'd think i'd be rolling in cash!! But the feetconomy is tough these days i guess......

I hate how engineering students always brag about having 7 courses and everyone praises them for it while nursing students have 6-7 courses with at least one clinical day a week. I always hear stuff about how easy it is to be a nurse and how you’re always below everyone on a medical field scale blah blah but it’s actually not as easy as everyone thinks. I know it’s not a competition, but damn I wish I only had 7 courses and was recognized for it lol

Thien Nguyen Nursing used to be part of Applied Science, so we engineers count you as family.
Nursing is hard, even harder than engineering. When engineers graduate, they often work normal business hours, or even flexible hours. Nurses have to follow their shift schedule, often include night shifts, which can really mess up their sleep cycles. I don't think I can endure shift work like that.

From defunding SASC to refunding it, intimidating councillors and staff, plus lack of/poor consultation, illegal access of clubhouse for emails, they screwed up alot and now the Ubyssey article suggests it may be name recognition.

While the prof was talking, she was going through the slides of the lecture and suddenly I started to notice she was translating "the", "what", "with", and some basic, *essential* English words to Chinese. She gave up and translated the whole sentences lol.

When I got to UBC and went to my first frat party, it felt like i finally had people around me who liked me even though that's never really the case at frat parties. It still felt like i had a sense of belonging more than I ever have before. After about my third frat party I felt like I was pretty done with that whole scene so I went to a house party.

Trigger warning: Mental Health

Berating someone with anxiety and depression, interrogating them about their lifestyles and telling them they are having a breakdown does not help them at all. Reminding or trying to diagnose someone through "you are not okay, you are a wreck, or you are having a breakdown" does not give people with mental illness any sort of comfort. We know we are not okay, we know there are things we need to take care of in life. We have our own goals ...

Grace Ho OP, you need to sell this issue to your parents as a) being your responsibility as a child to relieve them of any burden (and this is the best way you can start doing this) b) you need life experience by getting a job, because employers these days don't just freaking look at your grades.

I just witnessed some drunk ass dude pee outside my window. My window blind was up and his posture at first confused me. He was mumbling some weird shit and I could hear the buckle of his pants and zipper after he finished. Because my room is on the first floor, there has been times where people startled me by banging my window. So this time, I thought the same would happen. But no.

He just peed ಠ_ಠ...

in my CS labs, i overheard a couple people talking about UBC being "unwelcoming" and "unfriendly" and I couldnt believe it. first off, these people are the classmates you have that you see everyday but just dont talk to. i make an effort to say hello and asked about school and whatnot since i see them everyday. but they usually turn their head and brush me off. its crazy that they then go around and talk about ubc being a bad place to make friends.

On my visit to Japan couple years ago, I bought some doujins at Comiket. I waited hours in line just to get in so I figured the least I could do was buy some merch. Little did I know 90% of it was just hentai. I visited 2 booths and picked some doujins from series I liked. After bringing it back home, I worried my parents would somehow find it in my room so I decided to bring them with me in my backpack to class.

Cem Özcan Well to all the non psych peeps , actually accepting the problem is a part in cognitive behavioural therapy. Accepting rather than dismissing it actually does help and it is used to relieve panic attacks with a lot of people. It is odd but there is a saying , “if you can’t manage a way out of it , actually enjoy the ride”

The UNIK x JA White Day event was horrible. We paid $6 (or $10 for non-members) to play BINGO, the stupid human-knot game, eat 1 rice ball, pancakes and kimchi that gave a lot of people FOOD POISONING. The president of UNIK sent out a poorly worded apology letter that pretty much said "sorry, but our execs also got food poisoning :\ " We paid $10 to get poisoned because the UNIK and JA execs didn't know how to wash their hands before making food and improperly stored the food. UNIK and JA should be refunding all the participants.

Tw: eating disorder

I've found myself obsessing over what I'm eating for the past few months, barely eating during the week only to have really bad binge days where I'll eat thousands of calories in everything from uncooked ramen to raw oatmeal packets. I don't like the way my body looks, even though I'm not overweight. I don't like binging, but I also don't like eating the crap around campus either. I've just been shrugging it off but I've been hating myself for my weird eating habits more and more.

I lost my Dad just under a year ago. While there are an incredible amount of things that make me sad and miss him everyday, one that makes my heart ache even a little extra is not getting a response after sending him dumb memes I know he would have laughed for days at. There were memes he'd bring up and laugh at literally years after seeing them. I think I just miss being able to share a laugh with him, and knowing that something as small as sending a meme was enough to make his day.
Appreciate your rents, folks.

The recent scandal regarding the elite paying their child's way into colleges got me thinking. I swear some people in UBC might have bought their way in or bought their way for a passing grade. I'm a fourth year, and some people in my cohort have zero grasp of the fundamentals taught in second year, without which you could not pass at all. I have no idea how they made it this far. Not just specific to my faculty, I've experienced the same taking courses from other faculties. It doesn't help that a majority of these people happened to be international students. It's either they've bought their way in, or UBC meddles with grades of international students so they look good to prospective international students. And the latter is not unrealistic. There should be an investigation regarding this.

Today, my friend and I were going to marine drive ballroom for our Friday Jummah Prayers. After the shooting that occurred at Christchurch mosques we were all feeling a bit unsafe and at unease but and as we were heading walking to the entrance, we noticed couple of campus security personnel and police officers keeping watch over us, to protect us . We were praising and smiling about this beautiful gesture ,as we looked at one of the officers, he smiled at us and that made all fear go away. I'm glad the majority people of the world know that we are all the humans going through the same journey of sadness,laughter, happiness and love. God bless Canada <3

Forgot to post earlier but at the start of this semester i hung up the trans pride and gay pride flag in my room. To my bemused horror my new bedders didnt quite understand and actually asked me what country i was from.

Hungover, in my pyjamas and clutching a bowl of cereal i was too awkward to out myself as trans so i panicked and said i was from Transylvania. In hindsight not my best move, but they didnt misgender me again, so a net win!

UBC should fund SASC completely instead of students having to pay more for it. UBC always "talks" about mental health and how important it is, they also like to "talk" about raising awareness about and helping victims of sexual assault. Enough with just talking, UBC needs to take action. They can't even provide their students with proper support. All they care about is their "prestigious" ranking which isnt even based on undergrad stuff.

TLDR: UBC needs to stop pretending like they care and actually do something to help students struggling with their mental health and others who have been victims of sexual abuse/assault/etc.

It really disturbs me that so many UBC students take people like Ben Shapiro and Laura Southern so seriously that their events get sold out. Like, how can you support such people who spread hate against Muslims?

I don’t feel safe at UBC health wise. There is so much shit wrong with UBC’s medical device protocol, the hospital is a joke, and not to mention the severe lack of a half decent mental health support system (a rant for another time). I am a student who happens to have a heart problem. I will pass out, have a seizure, and can’t function as a human being for a solid three days afterward. The scary thing is, I DON’T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO MY HEART WHEN I PASS OUT! Does it s...

Writing in support of #11352 where they called out SUS execs as pre-meds for their resumes.

I got to work with some of the execs this year as their committee member, and some of them were some of the worst people I've worked with. I'm not going to name drop, but either they never showed up to meetings, had no idea what they were even doing, or were just rude to me straight up. Another one of them would always say "not my problem" because when shit went wrong for anothe...

Let's all appreciate how the economics undergraduate society (VSEUS) miss calculated the supply and demand for their year-end gala tickets. The tickets sold out in 15 minutes and they let people buy up to eight tickets. You are essentially promoting arbitrage at this point. Folks, this is what is claimed to be the top ranked economics school in Canada

Biochem PhD here, I'd like to share an experience regarding the arrogance of STEM.

One day, circumstances required that I take a different route to work. I was on my way to the massive, shiny, multimillion dollar building (where my lab is) when I suddenly really needed to piss and walked into the nearest building to find a washroom - which happened to be some Arts building. I don't even know what it's called....

I am a Middle-Eastern descent, male, international student, a few days ago I was going back to my residence at night. There happened to be a girl who walked from the same path with me over 10 mins.

I get the whole sustainability thing and all that jazz and honestly I'm happy we're taking even small steps towards sustainability with the paper straws but fuck, somebody needs to get on developing biodegradable straws that don't melt in your fucking drink the minute you put them in fucking asap.

Highkey shoutout to the Department of Linguistics, such a small department but all the profs are so dedicated to what they do, and always seem so passionate about it. The same goes for the students. I love being a linguistics major because I've never seen such a tight-knit department where all the students seem to have each others' backs. Love you LING fam <3

Ok so I am a white girl from a European country with no asian people. After I come to ubc I realized I have an asian fetish. I just think asian guys are super sexy and watch amwf porn a lot. I am also in engineering so there are a lot of asian guys in my classes. I fantasized about some of my classmates while masturbating. I have a boyfriend whom I have been dating for three years (he is going to college back home and he is white) and I love him but I also want to have sex with an asian guy so badly. 😩😩😩

I was lining up for coffee at the Tims next to Sauder and overheard two Chinese girls talking in Mandarin. I couldn’t believe what I heard and felt so shame on my own Chinese background.

Apparently, a group/organization is trying to manipulate the course registration system at UBC. They bribe upper years students to register popular courses and sell the seats to students in need. It could get up to $500/seat. The two girls said the university is aware of human involvem...

If UBC has taught me anything, it is that family and health is more important beyond any degree. Many of us (myself included) sacrifice our health to get a "prestigious" degree which may end up uselsss. During our studies, we often forget about the important things in life like family. Life sometimes seems too busy for family but make time for them. It really saddens me when I see people treat their friends better than their parents. Friends are important but not as valuable as your parents. I can guarantee you if you got hospitalized, your friends won't take time out of their lives to take care of you but your parents would, without a doubt. All I want to say is take care of your health and cherish your parents. The time we have together is shorter than you realize.

I can't stop thinking about that confession that was like "oh people in Vancouver are so cold, nobody ever talks to you on the bus" because uh, people talk to me on the bus all the time and I HATE it. What is it about a girl with headphones on staring out the window that makes old people and fuckbois think "hmmmm, she looks like a good conversational partner." I'm not riding the bus because I want to socialize with strangers, I'm riding the bus because driving is fucking expensive. So PLEASE, leave me alone.

TLDR; I think one of my close friends is toxic but I don’t know how/if I should end the friendship when it’s one of the only ones I have.

This year I became close friends with these two people which is a big deal for me as I’m slightly introverted and generally have a hard time developing meaningful relationships with others. Everything was going great for the first few months, we were always having fun, hanging out outside of school, and because we are all in the same...

I ended up leaving midway and dropping the class that same day. I was so scared of Chem 233 that I decided to switch my major just to avoid it. It's was great being a bio student arts here I come.😑

I can't even begin to describe the amount of pain I, my family, and his friends are feeling. Hardly any of us knew he was struggling. I just want to reach out here, even if it helps a single person. Please seek help. Please reach out. You are not alone. UBC has the resources; resources that I believe are made way more available compared to UofT. I ...

A message to all the people with cars who take transit when two snowflakes hit the ground. Stop doing that!

Every single time we get a light dusting in Vancouver the bus and skytrain is overflowing with people who don't usually take transit (you can tell because they struggle with the complexity of transit. Like tapping your card. Or pulling for stops). But your presence makes the already congested commute so much worse. ...

Daniel Humphreys Please risk the safety of other vehicles/pedestrians by driving in icy winter conditions, knowing that you may not have winter tires and may be a liability on the road. (:
Just kidding, keep taking transit as it helps the environment and keeps overall safety as a first!

Robin Newhouse I dunno, maybe people with cars should be taking transit more often anyway.
Not like there's a global environmental crisis or anything...

As a first generation immigrant, for most of my life I've been immensely grateful for the opportunity to be here in Canada. My parents did all they could so I that could grow up here with the promise of more opportunities.

In recent years, however, I've begun to doubt whether that promise stayed true....

Sometimes I wish I was a girl. Why? They are so lucky they don’t need to do their hair in the morning because of those awkward morning hair where the hair is so messy when you wake up and can’t get the hair to go down. Girls on the other hand only need to tie a pony tail or bun if their hair messy and boom they are done out of the bathroom in a few mins while I am trying to push down my hair for 5-10mins with no success

Today, I was walking through the Nest and was leaning on the glass next to a stairwell on the main floor. By chance, I looked down into the stairwell and I could see a Muslim student praying. You wouldn’t be able to see him just walking by, but I was right along the window and angled so that I could. When I saw him move from sajdah (the position similar to child’s pose but with the head on the floor and hands beside the head) and rise to his knees to complete the praye...

I am an international student that has to take public transit, and respectfully I’m just wondering.. for a modern city of the first world, why is Vancouver’s public transport, mainly Translink, so bad? I understand that there’s many uncontrollable factors to it, but Translink is so consistently bad with timely arrivals/departures in particular that it seems that they aren’t able to improve their existing processes at all to address the factors they come across on the daily.. is Vancouver trapped with this poor standard of transport, or will there ever be salvation for commuting citizens hopefully sometime in the future? 🤔

Everyday I shut myself into the hidden bathroom in the stairwells of the buchanan tower and jack off. The backround chatter heard through the air vents turn me on so much. Just the prospect of being found out makes me nut into a new dimension.

She genuinely thinks the earth is flat and i can confirm she is being 100% serious after 20 mins of conversation. Shes a 11/10 but idk if i can put my dick inside her anymore.

So it's about 8PM at IKB on a Monday and I go to find myself a seat to study for an upcoming midterm. Personally I study best along the hallways on floors 2-4 where the tables and chairs are bar height. I don't know why, but having my feet off the ground puts me in a better head space. So I weave along the floors looking for an empty table and, with no luck as it seems to be an exceptionally busy evening, I situate myself diagonal to a girl sitting alone at a table on ...

Not gonna lie, but I really like old men feet. I specifically choose my profs based on their age and height to maximise my chances of getting big footed senior hottie. My preference scale goes from 0 being smooth to 10 being 4 hours after being in a hot tub. This semester I have daddy jim Berger as my foot hottie. I’m not his class as I am in csp, but I imagine the science one kids and their luck at being able to see daddy Jim and juicy feet all lecture. I’m glad I’m not in his class or else I’d fail. All I want is his wrinkly toes, specifically his big toe, rubbing on my face.

When my mom told me about this article she read, on how jogging makes people happier, I didn't really believe her, since she always believes stuff from random internet sources.

I don't really remember how I started jogging. I was feeling really down and lonely at the time, so maybe I just really wanted to feel happy and was willing to try something. But either way, I'm glad I did it. Taking a light jog out in the sun always leaves me feeling more relaxed and positive afterwards, and I look forward to all the sunny days now :)

It saddens me that it took me, similar situations as minorities, for lack of better phrasing, to finally recognize my privilege. It is also disheartening that people act like privilege is a bad word. I’m a white woman, and often, since recently recognizing white privilege, has lead people to think I’m a race traitor, or something of the likes.
To get to the point, it frustrates me when men, and specifically white men, are angry that women and minorities cry racism or s...

Trademark science kid taking breadth electives. What I have been blown away with is how nice everyone is. You arts kids are nice to your prof, I haven't had nearly the same amount of awkward silences where the class knows the answer but just unanimously agrees to not say it. You are even nice to the keener kids and there isn't the waves of annoyance going through the class when the keener kid brings up an other redundant question. Is this what a supportive environment is supposed to be?

Now that CoCo is open in the village and I see everyone walking around campus with their coco cups, I’ve been wanting it more and more.... and it somehow makes want to drink boba when I NEVER use to crave it. Bruh this boba culture is affecting my life and this addiction is too expensive for me to spend $6/day so TLDR; i need a boba baba thank u.

WHOLESOME STORY: So yesterday I was trying to find a table to work at Koerner and I see this girl doing her work on her laptop. It seemed to be nothing at first but I noticed a dude's face in the corner of her laptop and he was just smiling. I got really confused but then realized that they were just facetiming and they muted each other so it's literally just each others' presence while they were studying and I think IT'S SO CUTE.

My faculty should probably be the most adept at giving its students health services and handling mistreatment reporting professionally. I won’t say which faculty it is but we made the news over students reporting harassment and mistreatment recently. You know what their response was aside from scrambling to make it look like they’re doing something? Minimize the statistics, refuse to release the full reports and basically tell us we don’t know what harassment is. And then to boot they gave us all of TWO resources and didn’t even include sasc. How can you expect us to give good care if you can’t even model it? I haven’t told any of my classmates this but I’m pretty sure we deserve any downranking we get from this.

I let it slide when the Sex Issue only featured fingered melons and defiled dragon fruit, and no crossword. However, yesterday was one step too far. Not only was I given a “magazine” devoid of crossword, it wasn’t even printed on glossy magazine paper but on ideal crossword paper.
There is only one thing I have to say: ...

I'm sick of seeing all these depressing posts about not being able to find friends on campus.

I commuted for 4 years and couldn't for the life of me find a community I liked or felt comfortable with. Religious clubs, clubs related to what I was studying, people who had the same hobbies, etc....

The thing I'm most looking forward to about spring is finally seeing the end of those multi-coloured sheep-like fuzzy jackets; it seemed like they were everywhere last semester (I tried counting but I fell asleep). While I appreciate their warming properties and the fact that they make for a cheap Boohbah cosplay, I can only imagine the casualties if sheepdogs were released on campus...

To all who reply to suicidal posts on here, offering support and sympathy:
What do you do in your daily exchanges with people to promote mental health and meaningful relationships? The cynic in me can't help but wonder if the public displays are not just virtue signalling. Please prove me wrong

I met my girlfriend when she was crying and looked stressed during midterms last term and I thought in a non creepy and non sexual way approach her (I would be lying though if I said she wasn’t so cute looking) and ask if she was alright and she said no and wanted to talk so I listened to her and made her feel better. Fast forward final seasons in December she messages me and wants to talk (I left my contact saying reach out whenever you want to talk) and so I agreed because I as a socially awkward loner guy wanted to talk to. And then in January we talked more and now I am dating her. Moral of the story: be nice to girls and guys you see stressed :)

I feel like this NEEDS to be posted as recently I’ve read some disturbing, disheartening, selfish replies to recent depression and suicidal UBC Confessions submissions.

Some people seem to be under the impression that submissions of depressing nature should be censored and filtered out or moved to their own segregated “depression page” because it makes them feel uncomfortable or depressed themselves. Fuck you, go fuck yourself asshole....

Went to Surrey last week to meet a friend of mine. I was sitting in this bus 319, which also goes in the direction of KPU. A student gets on the bus, looks at the driver and says "KPU". the driver with a confused expression points towards the compass tap stand. This kid gets his face close to the compass stand and says "KPU". Ded.

After seeing the jalapeño cunnilingus confession, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a shot. Only I didn’t have any jalapeños so I made him take a bite out of a habanero. And it was terrible. My vagina feels like it’s being branded with a hot iron and my boyfriend feels like he’s about to faint. But then again, he did mention before that a single habanero is the equivalent of 40 jalapeños, seeds and all.

I'm an Asian girl and the amount of shit that I've gotten from both Asian girls and white dudes for saying "I prefer dating Asian guys" is insane. I'm not even saying "I only date Asian guys." I have a preference, but I'm not opposed to any race. Other Asians just happen to have similar values and experiences that I gravitate towards in a relationship.

Some of my Asian girlfriends get mad at me for being "racist" for "excluding other races" no matter how many times I ...

Ioana David Hi OP, you can definitely choose to seek legal action. However, I will warn you that it is a long and difficult road and if you have no proof then it may be very difficult to be able to press charges. Unfortunately, that's the way the system is, but there are tons of resources available on campus to help you here at UBC. Best of luck and you can always reach out if you need to talk to someone.

Here's the story of another eng kid who wants to drop out but the tale I'm about to tell is a bit different than most.

I'm here on my own accord. My parents never pressured me to go into eng or anything, they were nothing but excited for me and support me. I'm also here on scholarship so it seems like everything should be perfect. My dream career is to become an engineer as I truly love the field of study and what I can do with the degree in terms of the types of jobs...

UBC people need to chill with the networking and/or get better at it - I was at a conference recently (I'll keep it ambiguous for anonymity) but in sum the event was composed of professionals and graduate students. The professionals and graduate students were there for a competition and network, and there were a handful of undergraduates (myself included) there to help out. Unfortunately, there were a couple undergrads from UBC who seemingly exclusively volunteered to...

I'm gonna be honest when I first heard an Asian speak coherent English, I was in disbelief. I'd never seen anything like that back where I came from. As a white South African, I only expected white people to speak correct English, or sometimes the Indians. It's a trippy experience for me when I cross paths with an Asian student, her ability in speaking English is as good as mine but she ...looks..... Chinese, or Japanese or you get it. It makes me feel out of place but then I also wonder how much they know their own language - Mandarin. Did they give up their culture to try to fit in Canada's culture? I can tell you that as a white South African, I've always cherished my African country and European ancestry, and I proudly call myself a South African who belongs to Africa.

Unpopular opinion, but studying with friends is possibly the worst thing ever. In my experience, it is impossible to study EFFICIENTLY especially when you bring a large group with you.

Everyone in this university seems at least mildly mentally ill. From narcissism to depression. It really fucks with me and makes me feel depressed myself. I’m in my 4th year at UBC, the serious lack of empathy needs to be addressed. It’s obviously a systemic issue that goes beyond the university, but the shitty mental health services and the cold student culture doesn’t help.

That being said, there are inevitably a great many things that really chap my nips. I’ve found that a fun way to vent some of my pent up irritation is to write down my own little rants on these things in a journal of sorts. I called this ledger of misery “My Big Book of Grievances” ("Friends" fans might get the reference) and I’ve decided to begin ...

I love my boyfriend. He does whatever I tell him. I hold his chin and make him take a big bite out of a jalapeño before he goes down on me. The spicy feeling on my vagina makes it soooo much more intense and his tongue moves so much faster since he want to cool it down.

10/10 recommended.

Okay so first off I know this is gonna sound like shitty as fuck, but I need to get this out in the open. So today was laundry day, so I had all of my laundry in the machine, which I left unattended because midterm season. Now, I know that it is kinda dicky to leave your clothes in the washing machine for a long time, but five CUNTING MINUTES is not long enough for SOME BITCH TO COME IN AND TAKE MY SHIT OUT OF THE FUCKING MACHINES. I don't get even. I get even with int...

The other day I was at the Pizza Garden place at the uni village and these two dudes who were either drunk or on something else came in and started cussing out loud, banging the table and just acting like total violent assholes. I was surprised that the manager did not ask them to leave or call the cops on them for actually mishandling the place’s property. They then left after eating their pizza, trashing the floor with shit everywhere and jump kicking the glass door to the restaurant. In what scenario is that funny and people like these should be behind bars for the literal mayhem the caused in the restaurant. I wish the restaurant recorded this, I would love these mofos to be publicly shamed and charged.

tw sexual abuse

One time when I was about 7 years old my family and I went to visit one of my father's acquaintance's house. While the "parents" were chatting, the hosts told me to go and play with their children who were in high school/university at the time. When I went to their room, they opened porn in front of me and started jacking off to 3D furry hentai, which I unfortunately still remember quite vividly. As I didn't know what was going on, I asked them what this was about and they told me it was "grown-up stuff", and we could try it if I wanted to. I don't really remember what happened afterwards, but I like to believe it was nothing bad. I didn't really realise what had happened until I was in high school, and then it was too late.

BIE is probably the most scam faculty I've ever seen, why pay double so you can learn the same shit from GENERAL ECON. If you're a real economist, the benefit and cost analysis shows you that if you're in BIE you are making an irrational decision. With fees of around 10k a year, the better option is obviously Sauder, better job co-ops, more related financial and business courses etc, better networking events and people to meet. BIE does not provide that, but you pay...

TW: sexual assault

I don’t understand how the AMS and UBC can handle sexual assault without the police getting involved. It makes no sense to me. “Under section 22 of the Criminal Code of Canada, if an individual has an awareness of a crime because they have witnessed the crime or have been told that the crime has occurred, and by not reporting this crime to the police service or other relevant agency, this individual is in some way aiding or abetting the crime to take...

I saw a loving couple waiting for transit but seemingly going the opposite direction. Apparently one of them goes to UBC and the other to SFU. Then, I thought to myself: these two could turn out to be the modern Romeo and Juliet.

mmk mmk mmk here’s the fuckin thing. i’m from alberta. and i get just as annoyed as the rest of you with all of the self-fellating post by my fellow prairiepeople talking a big game about “oh ho ho i can dip my dick into the antarctic ocean vancouver snow is nothing” but i’m gonna let you in on a little secret: we are just as cold as you are. we still have to snuggle up with our space heaters after walking 5 blocks home in the blizzard. we just need you to believe that we are all big and tough because it’s all we got. if we can’t be “big strong albertans” the next step is “racist oil babies” and boy gee do we prefer the former.

Nothing better than listening to ppl from the rest of Canada spout off about how Vancouver can't handle snow, then see the look on their face when they start fishtailing on literal grease that is the snow out here lmao. The dry ass powder y'all get over there is not the same as the sloppy grease bomb of slush that it is out here. Plus we have these things called turns and hills that make things a lil more complicated, y'all haven't seen those before @prairiekids so don't worry, your ignorance is forgiven lmao /end rant
Anyway
It's greasy out bois, stay safe ✌

And now here I am, making our friendship dynamic weird and adding this weight between us. Hopefully she doesn’t hold th...

TL;DR: If you have a problem say it. Don’t be a coward and don’t throw your identity around as an insult.

I was sitting in a dinning hall with my friends on a Monday night. Midterms are on the horizon, tensions are high and honestly we needed a good break. We’re having fun laughing very loud, we recognize a few people walking by, they sit with us, we laugh even louder and they leave. ...

After reading about the strawberries and cum confession, I admit, my interest was piqued. Unfortunately, I'm a girl and so had to wait for my boyfriend to cum home.

Sadly, I didn't have strawberries, so I made a sandwich with man mayo instead. It was pretty meh, my sandwich was still dry....

Help! My homies have been getting sick. First it was just one of them, then he spread it to the other guys. Even the ones who I thought were strong minded got infected.

Now I'm friends with a bunch of 18 year old guys who watch anime, are crazy about k-pop and have female k-pop stars as their profile pictures. They even send cancerous anime memes and I swear a couple of them are getting into hentai. What am I supposed to do? How do I convert them back and make them normal again? They even keep wondering why they don't have girlfriends 🙄

My roommate kept stealing my food, and I persistently told them to "fuck off" politely. O boy one day I had it. I added laxative to one of my dishes, and I made sure he shitted himself all the way to the moon. P.S. sorry to the UBC staff on campus for what ever may of occurred in the bathrooms.

Okay time to rant.
Everyday I wake up in the morning, ready to go about my day and have a good time. Then it hits me. THE THOUGHT OF GUM UNDER EVERY SINGLE SEAT IN CIRS. I have many questions. First, WHY do people do this? It's so disgusting. Seriously? Can't they just chew the gum for like ten more minutes and then throw it in the trash? People will go above and beyond to keep the environment clean and then they do shit like this. Also, why aren't the lecture rooms cl...

Every time I take a dump, I photograph it and write a journal entry on my phone. In my fecal diary, I especially keep track of the shape, size, scent, and colour of my fecal matter. It's my secret fear that someone will stumble upon and learn my shitty secret.

How does birdcoop still not have a paid Spotify account? Looking at how many people there are at 5pm rush, they should have enough to buy 40 yrs of spotify. I'm so done listening to Honda ads after every second song.

I have maybe only 2 or 3 friends who know about this, but I'm going to publicly confess this. I buy bubble tea with pearls and drink the tea, taking special care not to swallow any pearls. I take the pearls home and individually wash them off. Then I get undressed on the bed, stick the straw in my ass, and individually let the pearls down the straw. Gravity does most of the work, but sometimes they get stuck and I give the straw a little tap. I walk around and get used to the feeling of boba in my ass, and then wait till I need to shit. I have a 96% ejection rate, but I'm not sure where the rest of them go.

First year in Engineering, I was seeing all these confessions about how engineering students can't get girls, and I was like "it can't be that bad, we're not that unattractive".
3 years later, the girl who's been telling me how cute I am all semester, and casually bring up that she's single in conversation, suddenly didn't really want to talk to me again after the semester ended....

One good thing about this cold weather (I’m from Alberta by the way and this “cold” is nothing. It’s a spring breeze there) is that all the dog owners dress their dogs up in cute sweaters and costumes. It’s such a mood booster during midterm season.

I know this will get me killed more so than any thing else like being a Trump supporter or whatever... But I hate the UBC Vancouver cultural obsession.
It's fine to find the main campus cool. But it's weird as fucking fuck to be obsessed with it. Like, the main campus lovers act like their life revolves around it. If I acted like my life revolved around UofT St. George or some shit, people will find it weird. So I really don't get why people are okay with the weird as ...

Recently I've seen a lot more animal activists, and Men's Rights groups set up outside the Nest. Each time there is a healthy amount of people engaging in debate and dialogue with them, although I haven't actually joined in the debates I think its great that students engage with the issues.

What surprises me, however, is that essentially nobody debates the presence of Catholic Church associations or Chinese Nationalist associations and their presence on campus. These a...

My dad told me he interviews students including ubc students for banking (yes investment banking) and he told me he feels sorry for us student whenever he sees the stress and forced smiles and manners students put up to impress him. He said he really wishes there could be more job because he just wants to hug students because he sees me in their position and pain. I really didn’t expect my dad to be so nice to others considering how hard he has been on me all my life and never saying he’s proud of me. I actually thought he was one of those bitchy interviewers that interogate you

UBC's mental health services are a fucking joke. For a school that advocates for their services and how important mental health is, its enraging what you have to go through to actually see someone. Man like I have a psychiatrist referral from my psychiatrist back home and they still wouldn't let me see someone. I'm fine thankfully, I'm taking meds that are actually working and I don't think I need to see someone, but so many people around me are struggling with serious...

I have a very hard time being a shape-shifting reptilian at UBC. Shuffled from one Buchanan discussion to the next I feel like I'm being constantly criticized as a human-flesh-eating lizard. "Illuminati confirmed" and "stop the New World Order" are thrown around so lightly by these pent up humans in my classes. I honestly feel like existing as a lizard without apologizing for your tendency to eat newborn infants at UBC immediately draws the wrath of all of these so cal...

So the other day, I stumbled upon some porn where dude takes turn jacking off onto fruit and then a girl eating that fruit. I had some strawberries in my fridge and immediately got the urge to try that.

After grabbing my strawberries from the fridge, I went to town and creamed my strawberries. It looked exactly like strawberries coated in condensed milk. Not gonna lie, it looked tasty. I ate them all with delight.

Nobody takes me seriously when I say this but I legitimately think BC should build a wall on the border with Alberta and force people from Alberta to go through a strict vetting process.
Back when Alberta's economy went down the shitter and a ton of Albertans moved to BC, the crime rate slowly went up here. In my neighbourhood, there were a couple of incidents committed by Albertans that traumatized me. You could bet when something bad happened, it was probably an Albe...

It's fine to find the music cool. But it's weird as fucking fuck to be obsessed with it. Like, the Kpop lovers act like their life revolves around it. If I acted like my life revolved around Jay-Z or some shit, people will find it weird. So I really don't get why people are okay with the weird as kpop band obsession...

Trigger warning:
To be honest I hate that whole bell lets talk thing cause it doesn’t do shit. As a person who suffers from a mental illness (anxiety attacks) I tried to be open about it with my friends because I needed someone to talk to. It just ended up them getting more and more distance(or at least that how it feels) and just being plain hurtful. I try to be honest and I have been healing and reflecting but that was all on my own. Saying that going out and talking to someone doesnt always help cause you don’t know how that person will react. To be honest it did make my condition worse but i got better. It just pisses me off to see those exact people posting that bell lets talk stuff when in reality they shouldn’t be the ones talking. Sorry for this rant it’s just too much bullshit.

Bobby BM Bell let’s talk is just a progressive marketing scheme from the company. We can break stigma all we like, doesn’t treat the underlying cause of the epidemic. Won’t happen though as companies like Bell have a vested interest in a mentally-ill consumer base. Shits like currency now

My TA really loves to flex to the class that she can speak French (it isn't a french class) She would go and pronounce words in the heaviest french accent that no one in class understands and would then make a little smirk as if it's some sort of achievement. UBC is an ENGLISH school, unless the class is a language class then speak English, I'm sorry but most of us weren't raised in the Eiffel Tower to King Louis XVIII

I grew up in Vancouver and chose to go to UBCO, and I must admit that UBC’s Point Grey campus is a great institution. The class sizes are bigger, there are less opportunities to connect with profs and you’re able to not get the benefits of a smaller university. That being said, I have a lot of friends who go to UBCPG and it isn’t cool when UBCPG students omit the extremely important “PG” at times when it benefits them.

It bothers me SO MUCH when people state they go to...

I never thought too much about those chair stains in the library room. If they were dark someone probably sat on a piece of their peperoni pizza during their all nighter. if they’re the weird white stains, i just assumed they were some sweat stains of a 4 gpa person. So I usually sat on those white stains hoping I will absorb some of that persons intellect.

boy was I right. ...

Coop sucks. I am only a month in in Toronto and I have such a mean boss who works me to death and gives me so much to do. I told him I really can’t take it anymore and he said he wasn’t begging me to stay and I can leave if I want to or do more work and then went on a rant on how when he first started he was so grateful and never complained how much work he got and that it’s his right to assign me work. He then said if I am paying you I need to get my money’s worth. Fml I feel like I am treated as a machine capital. I literally work 9am-10pm on weekdays and half days on weekend and get no overtime bonus

Hi guys! This month marks a year after I have arrived in your beautiful campus for a quick exchange, I know it's pretty self-indulgent at this point, but I'd just like to say this. To all the people who are struggling there, given how bleak winter there tends to be, you will always be deserving of love (be it self-love and/or the love of others) and you will always matter. There's still hope.

Love,...

Dear Blue Chip,
I felt betrayed when you gave me an over-baked cookie. Not only does a crunchy cookie rank far beneath a heavenly chewy one, but I've realized it takes away one crucial feature - subtle cookie eating in class. I realized this when heads whipped my way after the heart-dropping CRUNCH I experienced upon first bite.
Nevertheless forever yours,...

TW: Suicide

Last year, a group project member of mine committed suicide. I only found out that she passed away because some students in my faculty were sharing a memorial page under her name. I remember searching all over the internet to find her cause of death, but was unable to find anything related to her name that would indicate foul play. Of course we all know about suicide and mental health, but I never expected it to happen to someone I knew personally. She was ...

I tried my girlfriend skinny jeans on and I almost broke it because it was so tight and hard to wear to get past my ankle that I heard a stretch and it was so hard to remove it. It also felt like my penis was getting touched the whole time and couldn’t expand ( I had an erection for some reason wearing her jeans) and was gonna explode through her tight jeans. I saw her wearing that jean today but I don’t think she knows I wore it too and got turned on by it.

I do not understand how UBC, an institution that considers itself to be high-ranking among institutions around the world, is so lenient to its staff when it comes to the release of grades.

Our class had one final paper due near the beginning of exams in December (December 12th) and no final exam. This particular course had three sections in total. The other two sections received their grades as normal, however my singular section has still not received grades. How doe...

Last exam season, I started listening to white noise, and eventually started listening to those 10 hour clips of rain sounds while I studied. Surely they helped me focus, and I did well on my exams, but in the long term? Biggest. Regret. Ever. I've now Pavlov'd myself to be in a state of stress (with a dash of focus) whenever I hear rain, so every time it rains at night I have war flashbacks of Managerial Economics. Please send help.

Hey OP of confession #11013, I just wanted to say that I'm really sorry that you're going through this. What you're going through, although awful and you shouldn't have to be going through it, are completely normal responses to trauma and seeing people who trigger reminders of that trauma. I also wanted to give you a message of hope, because while I'm not you, I've gone through the exact same thing. I had a group of "friends" in my first year of university who would tr...

Two days ago I was having a mediocre day and it was pouring rain at night. I was walking back to my dorm with both hoodies pulled over my head to keep as dry as possible. Then, out of nowhere a small car pulled up by the sidewalk and some dude asked me to hop in since it was pouring outside. He drove me back to my dorm and told me he was making an Uber eats delivery in the area. While the chat was super short, we had some good dialogue and I was really grateful for his random kind gesture. If you read this, thanks man! Even though I was still kind of soaked, you really made my night! Hope to see you around again someday haha!

tldr: brown rice is fucking disgusting

Ok so I'm asian and I've been living in Canada for about half of my life. I just want to ask that why do people eat BROWN RICE here in UBC like wtfff why the hell is the rice brown I've never ever seen people eat such things before coming to UBC. It taste fucking disgusting! It's like rice but without the soft texture and beautiful flavour. They should as least offer the choice of real rice and brown rice but many residence dining areas only offer brown fucking rice wtf????!!!!

When I first came to Vancouver, I thought of the "Vancouver Freeze" as a funny idiosyncrasy. But a couple years in, it's really starting to wear me down. Like, you can't strike up a conversation with someone on the street, or the bus or SkyTrain? Why? Would it kill you all to be just a bit friendlier?

Amanda V. Tabert I know for some people this is really isolating, but individuals such as myself - who prefer living in cities for the opportunities - don't like to be bothered. If I'm on the train or the bus, I am usually going to work or to school, which is when I prefer to be left in peace rather than be trapped into a conversation I didn't want to be in.

I always wished that I could be like the person who seemed to be able to chat and be friends with everyone, and I thought maybe I was just born to be shy, that maybe in my next life, I can be born with better social skills.

I started learning about the psychology of introvertedness, and going through every learning resource I can about how to talk to people and...

I would like to thank everyone who post all their personal shit on UBCC, it is truly worth every minute spent on Facebook. Thanks to the people telling their fucked up stories, yes I'm looking at you "betting on peoples lives" and "double frat boy" posts. Thanks to all the people reminding us why we all love UBC, somewhere deep, DEEP in our hearts. Shoutout to all those sharing their confessions about their mental health (however good or bad), guys, you truly make me charish and appreciate all that I have and my life. Thank you UBC (and you non-UBC contributions, we all know our confessions page is better than yours) students. BEST. STUDENT. BODY. EVER.

All the dicklings out there (people with dicks) who use the life building bathrooms, just cause you don’t have to sit and pee doesn’t mean u can shower your fucking pee all around the seats and ground. Please, have some respect for the fellow pooping butt-siters and especially those with vaginas who need to sit to pee - Sincerely, a pained squatter desiring a comfy toilet seat to do her business.

Don't forget the ladies who are too afraid to sit on a toilet seat and choose to squat instead, spraying the seat in the process. Some even toss used tampons/pads into the toilet afterwards! It's a universal bathroom with universal problems. Don't blame one group of people for everything

Trigger warning

I took a gap year hoping that the scars from my high school would take the time the heal and move on — I desperately tried to work things through and keep myself afloat and away from memories of them. I went to a counsellor twice a week at first, then a once a week. I had lots of stuff going on but the explicit revelation that my friends hated me broke the camels back. I tried to disappear. ...

Max Hsu I didn’t have much friends in high school. Who cares. Make money and do whatever you want to do. Seems like you’re too focused on pleasing other people and worry about how they view you. Life is too short to worry. Just do what makes you happy, it could be a hobby or an activity that makes you happy.

I know my ex cleans the bathroom at a certain time at the cafe he works at so I make an effort to go use the bathroom and pee all over the seat and floor for him to clean up right before his cleaning. If I had a dick I would point it to even more places so he has to clean harder. That’s for being a dick to me in the relationship by always saying you had to work when in reality you just wanted to play your video games and couldn’t juggle your time with your work.

I think I’ve hit some kind of an academic wall. I’m in my fourth year, soo close to graduating, yet I’ve completely tapped out. I haven’t done any assignments, already skipped a bunch of classes, and I can’t bring myself to study. I’m so burnt out from years of this shit that I just... Can’t. I know that it’s weak and pathetic, there’s really no excuse, but I sit down to work and I’m so checked out that nothing gets done. This hasn’t been a problem for me in the past, but for some reason I am now simply unable to keep going. I feel like such a useless failure, and I just hope that by some miracle I can bring myself to pass these courses and graduate.

Trigger Warning: suicide

I’m in my mid twenties, and I’ve never been closer to suicide until now. This is going to be long and probably depressing, so if you’re interested in reading my life story summed up concisely, get ready....

Serious Question: why are block party tickets being sold in January??? The event is in April??? I wasn’t even thinking about the LDOC and now tickets are already being sold (non refundable too) and do they really expect me to be planning this far in advance???

I honestly can't understand why UBCO is allowed to be affiliated with UBC? Or at least why it is seen as a university of similar standard? It has sub-par admission requirements and its clear that students that attend UBCO just couldn't get in to UBC. If you can't get in, don't try and use the clout from university you couldn't even get into. I think it's embarassing that UBC tries to make more money by creating a second campus of much poorer quality and education stand...

Pamal Mangat This is the dumbest shit I've ever read! First of all speaking as someone who got accepted into UWaterloo and still chose to attend UBCO I think you should hear me out. First of all, I couldn't even apply to UBC van because of the stupid 2nd language requirements. UBCO is a great school with affordable tuition and it's not full of preppy rich Vancouver kids who think their entitled to everything.

As an UBC graduate and alumni, one of the biggest regrets that I have is having neglected to develop the social & romantic aspects of my life while I was a student. Dating and forging friendships are tremendously more difficult while out of school/working compared to being on campus, where you are surrounded by like-minded peers who share the same struggles and aspirations as you.

Granted, there certainly are upsides to bootstrapping your romance department post-school...

I keep a diary of all the dogs I see during my day at UBC. The more dogs, the better day I have. Just yesterday, I saw 5 golden retrievers, 2 labs, a collie, some small white asian dog, and a corgi. That day was one of the best days of my 4 years here. I even got to pet all of them!!!!!

Trigger Warning: suicide

I've written the day I plan to kill myself into my google calendar.
It's set for after I graduate because I made a promise that I would finish school and it took a lot of work and time to get here. It's a really weird feeling both terrifying and motivating because It's the reason I can't kill myself any sooner and if things improve by then I'll get to delete the event but I also know the day I'm going to die. I wouldn't recommend doing this by the way, it's not helped me not feel like shit in anyway.

I recently joined one of the professional programs at UBC. I'm grateful for the opportunities it's unlocked, and don't anticipate that to change, but I didn't expect to feel as socially isolated even though I was now part of a smaller group that shares classes and goals. The others don't seem to have the same problem, but I found it easy to get tired of the echo chamber of conversations about academics. I think the program selects for people who are more neurotic than typical, so talking with them only gives me anxiety. I went to the Nest to have lunch alone for once, and it was nice sitting with strangers also minding their own business in one of those lounge areas,. Even though I don't know any of you who were there, thanks for making me feel comfortable and like I belonged more than I ever did or probably will in my classes.

Few weeks ago, I was very drunk told him that I’m not able to stop sexually fantasizing about him and I’m taking help of alcohol to numb my desires. He got very angry when I expressed my desire to make love to him. But a week later, he said that if livi...

On top of that, I didn’t join a design team in first semester because I had a heavy course load that semester. I thought I could join one in second semester when I had less classes. I’ve applied to a lot of th...

In my 3rd year at UBC, I had 3 big essays due within a week. I couldn't grapple with the task and had to pay a writer to write 2 of them for $500. After essay submission, I was blackmailed to send in more money or they will inform UBC. I ended up paying $1000 more but they keep wanting more. I closed my laptop, and went to sit down with my professor to confess. I ended up having to rewrite the essays at the prof's mercy. This was the single most valuable lesson I've learned at UBC

UBC needs to make a mandatory course (1 credit) for all first years to teach them how to make friends, build connections, and communicate/socialize with the public. Im sure there are a good number of us that feel extremely lonely and don't really know how to communicate with fellow students. I find that most people you meet in class will most likely collaborate with you but after the course is over, they will never talk to you again.

Jenny Zhang This course may be useful to someone but it shouldn't be MANDATORY. Tuition fee for international students is high and they may not lack the skill of making friend and it's so unfair for them to pay the fee which is mandatory. That's ridiculous. Also, this is university and making friends should be a basic skill learnt by yourself. You need to step out of your comfort zone to do it:)

Biking through the UBC campus always feels like I'm piloting the Millennium Falcon through an asteroid field. Please walkers, just... don't always be looking down at your phone. Some spatial awareness around you would be cool. Bracing myself for the anti-bike comments, but the fact is pedestrians are much more annoying to bikers than the reverse, so take whatever complaints you have about bikers, multiply it by 10 and that's how annoying you are to us.

I'm a guy and I listen to Ariana Grande religiously. When I'm sad, boom No More Tears Left To Cry and Honeymoon Avenue. When I'm trying to get pumped up at the gym or before an exam, boom Dangerous Women. When I'm trying to chillax, boom R.E.M. When I'm trying to jam out, Let Me Love You or Sweetner.

You can like female artists my dudes. Doesn't make you ""less than a man"". I'm fact, I think it makes you more of a man by being yourself. Personally, I dont think it matters what genre or artist you listen to. I guess the point if this confession is to help liberate the those soft dudes out there that are embarrassed by their musical tastes--especially around their bro's.

As a closeted female bisexual, I am very happy to be in engineering. There are so few girls around that almost everyone I talk to is a guy, so I don't have to worry about falling for a girl and then everyone finding out. When I fall for a guy, it's just the usual "oh theres so many men in engineering, of course you can find ones you like"
...Joke on you all, I've been single for the past 5 years because I'm socially awkward and only talk to 4 people. please help

its true that I shouldn't blame everything on others, but is so frustrating that my parents can't even acknowledge they could control the monster of my sister. My sister is a lot older than me so when she was in highschool she used to bully me. It escalated until my parents found out she had other mental issues. I'm not trying to say mental issues should be ignored, bur they enabled her bullying just to keep her happy. She threatened suicide so much sometimes I wonder ...

My bedroom window back home faces a forest so I’ve never had an issue with privacy until I moved into OC. At the start, I was really paranoid with always keeping my blinds shut while changing and stuff, but I have officially stopped giving a shit. I’ve stripped with my blinds open, walked around in my underwear with them open, had sex with them open, etc. UBC has already taken away my money and my pride, might as well give away any sense of modesty as well.

Honestly the textbook industry bothers me so much. Look, I completely understand having to buy physical textbooks for classes and everything it makes perfect sense. But all this Mobius/Launchpad nonsense?!?!? I mean what the heck. You can resell a textbook but you can’t resell a code. I’m paying 80 bucks for essentially a rented online book and a ‘superior’ version of canvas quizzes and I’m frustrated.

I once jerked off while wearing a condom and threw the jizz filled rubber on a car in the street. If you found a jizz covered condom on your car, I'm not sorry, it was worth it

I am a polisci student so I just tell people I am a science student to avoid being judged and when asked deeper about what science I then say I study people since politics is about people anyway- a guy with an inferiority complex

My course still didn’t post marks (Dec. 30th today) and I keep seeing people frustrated on piazza 😂 But I really gotta ask because I’m curious myself, is there any UBC policy concerning professors/TAs not posting the marks before the new term starts?

I am a seasoned TA with years of experience and I think these posts about TAs banging students are just ridiculous (if they are even real that is). Either these TAs are complete amateurs (probably undergrads themselves) or just plain stupid. Most of us TAs are grad students who worked hard for years to get to where we are. So, why would we take the risk? The people in these posts...assuming they do make it past university and get into the workplace in future, imagine what would happen if they repeat this shit. Oh wait...nevermind, they would probably end up working as pimps and hookers. Wouldn't really need an university degree, if you ask me.

As a CBC, I feel it my obligation to educate the newcomers from the PRC of the Chinese plight beyond their country.

Many of you have grown up believing in the superiority of the West, only now to be disappointed by what you find to be aging and lacking infrastructure, and debilitating democractic governing institutions which hamper economic progress. Some of you can't even wait to leave, so superior is your home to what you have found here. The nationalists of your bu...

I've been in Sauder now for just over 3 years, and not once have I thought to myself, "Wow, I'm glad I spent over 30k on this experience!" In fact, I more often than not think, "Wow, I wish I had just googled this and saved myself the hassle." If it wasn't for Sauder's Alumni/student network, going to school would be completely useless. I've failed a total of 3 courses, have an average of about 62, yet I end up getting every single job I apply for. Why? Cuz I decided e...

I finally manage to find professor Robert Raussendorf so that I may discuss my project with him. He is just finishing up with one of his upper year students. I was not caught up in the minutia the discussion because my gaze was instead fixed on Robert as if bound by a divine creature. Fixed, I watched in awe while Robert described the complexities of quantum entanglement as if it were nothing to him. It truly was nothing to him. His rigid arms dance while he demonstrat...
